"Heard, Madison",mheard@csumb.edu,30-Aug-2016 9:24PM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Special Topic: Climate Change and Phenology,I am an undergraduate student,Population Biology and Ecology,,"Global climate change is driving two principle shifts in ocean conditions, including: warming of surface waters, and acidification and deoxygenation of deeper waters. These changes create stressful conditions within marine ecosystems and are projected to increase through this century and beyond. Seasonal events known as upwelling bathe coastal ecosystems in colder, nutrient-rich waters from deeper areas of the ocean, but the acidic, deoxygenated water caused by climate change is brought to nearshore-coastal communities from these seasonal events and can be potentially stressful for species inhabiting these areas. To assess the impacts of current and future upwelling-related ocean conditions, we selected the red abalone, *Haliotis rufescens*, as a model organism affected by upwelling dynamics. Few studies have been done to test the effects of simultaneous exposure to low pH and low dissolved O~2~ on developing embryos. In this novel study, we measured the effects a multi-stressor event, such as upwelling, would have on development of the CaCO~3~ dependent organism, *H. rufescens*. We compared the developmental stages from fertilization to hatching while abalone embryos were exposed to a treatment of either low pH/low O~2~, low pH/high O~2~, or a control treatment of high pH/high O~2~. This experiment evaluates whether these potentially harmful conditions would slow and/or impede the transition from early developmental stages to free-swimming planktonic larvae. Data suggests development in a low pH/low O~2~ environment will adversely affect hatching of *H. rufescens* embryos.",Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Recently (ca 2003), the invasive alga Sargassum horneri has proliferated throughout southern California, threatening algal species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, net community production (NCP) is being estimated on a subtidal rocky reef at Catalina Island that was recently invaded by S. horneri. Benthic chambers were used to estimate NCP. Chambers were flushed every four hours to avoid artificial ‘chamber effects’ and NCP was subsequently defined as the change in dissolved oxygen during each incubation period. We found that on a seasonal scale, NCP is driven most strongly by community composition and algal biomass. Mean NCP was highest in Spring when S. horneri was most abundant (1.63 O2 mg L-1 hr-1 ±0.49) and lowest in Summer (0.30 O2 mg L-1 hr-1 ±0.148) following the annual senescence of S. horneri. On a daily scale, the highest rates of NCP were observed in the morning to midday(1.09 O2 mg L-1 hr-1 ± 0.23); however, by the afternoon the community exhibited net respiration (-0.37 O2 mg L-1 hr-1 ±0.21). This change in NCP was inversely related to fluctuations in mean temperature during the incubation periods that presumably occurred from internal waves (mean morning incubation temperature: 18.15 ͦC ±0.03, mean afternoon incubation temperature: 21.88 ͦC ±0.07). This inverse relationship between temperature and NCP has implications for NCP in a warming ocean.",,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

To address this, we manipulated salt marsh plant diversity in a large-scale field experiment as part of a $4.1 million project targeted at restoring full tidal flow to Colorado Lagoon, Long Beach, CA. We quantified species-specific changes in plant cover one and three years post-restoration and evaluated the relative contribution of selection versus complementarity to overall diversity effects. Selection effects occur when species that perform best in monocultures also do best in mixtures, whereas complementarity effects occur when multiple species exhibit higher performance in mixtures, presumably due to resource partitioning or positive interactions between species. As expected, biodiversity enhanced primary productivity, with the magnitude of the effect increasing over time. Diversity effects were initially a function of selection, with the identity of the highest performing species varying with tidal elevation as predicted by recent theory. By the third year, however, selection effects had decreased and complementarity effects increased such that complementarity contributed most to observed diversity effects.

The distribution of common octocorals was scored by microhabitat, their nearest neighboring octocorals were scored to evaluate community implications of microhabitat choice, and for *Gorgonia ventalina*, the implications of microhabitat were evaluated through colony size. Sixty-one percent of *G. ventalina* was attached to vertical substrata, and 50% of *Antillogorgia* spp. was attached to horizontal surfaces. On horizontal and inclined substrata, holdfasts of *G. ventalina* were 25 ± 4 cm from the holdfasts of any other octocorals, but on vertical substrata they were separated from their nearest neighbors by only 8 ± 2 cm. *G. ventalina* was most commonly neighbored by *Eunicea flexuosa* (63% of cases) on vertical substrata where they were only 5 ± 1 cm apart. There was no difference in size of *G. ventalina* among microhabitats, indicating that microhabitat location does not affect adult success. Together, these results suggest that octocorals are distributed non-randomly across reef surfaces, with common taxa favoring vertical microhabitats where close spacing of octocorals suggests that spatial competition may affect community structure.",Community/Ecosystem Ecology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Intensified competition with an increasing Arrowtooth Flounder (ATF, *Atheresthes stomias*) population has been identified as one potential mechanism for reduced halibut productivity. As a first step toward addressing the potential for competition between PH and ATF, we evaluated their spatial and dietary overlap (a measure of resource partitioning). In 2015 and 2016, we collected 1716 PH and 683 ATF from nearshore SE Alaska to assess the spatial distributions and diet compositions of these groundfish predators. Specifically, we calculated catch rates, constructed size distributions, and analyzed size-based shifts in diet composition throughout the study area. Results showed species-specific differences in catch rates by site. Additionally, we found that ATF diets were comprised primarily of Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*), whereas PH with similar gape sizes exhibited more diverse diets and greater proportions of *Gadus* spp. These differences in niche width and size-specific distributions elucidate the multiple dimensions over which PH and ATF partition resources in nearshore habitats.

Previous studies showed that darker zooplankton were better protected from ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and more susceptible to predators. Yet this trade-off has not been comprehensively tested in larvae, which are subject to different selective pressures than holoplankton. I investigated the trade-offs in larval coloration by exposing crab larvae with a wide range of colorations to natural UVR and selective fish predation in different light conditions. Exposure to full sunlight induced mortality in all species, but even exposure to just visible light + UVA induced greater mortality in many species relative to controls exposed only to visible light. More darkly pigmented larvae generally fared better in sunlight than more transparent species. In predation trials where fish were presented with a choice between one species of transparent larvae and one species of pigmented larvae, fish only showed a preference for pigmented larvae in the absence of UVR. Fish generally consumed more transparent larvae in the presence than in the absence of UVR. These results help us understand how larvae balance the countervailing risks of predation and UVR exposure and which species may be most susceptible to these threats.

Larvae of some species detect cues from predators and avoid settling nearby, but there is mixed evidence from a limited number of studies regarding how predator presence influences settlement of coral-reef fishes.  Furthermore, it is unknown how other factors, including predator origin (native versus non-native) or interactions among conspecific recruits, mediate the non-consumptive effects of predators on reef fish settlement.  During a field experiment in the Caribbean, 52% fewer mahogany snapper (*Lutjanus mahogoni*) recruited to reefs with a native predator (graysby grouper, *Cephalopholis cruentata*) than to predator-free control reefs and reefs with an invasive predator (red lionfish, *Pterois volitans*).  These results suggest that snapper recruits do not recognize lionfish as a threat and thus may be particularly vulnerable to predation by this non-native predator.  However, the effects of predator presence depended on the density of conspecific recruits, with evidence that competition may limit the response of snapper to even native predators at the highest recruit densities.

This project focused on behavior and physiology of *Pocillopora damicornis* larvae using in situ incubations on the reefs of Okinawa, where freshly released larvae were exposed to ambient and elevated pCO~2~. To test the hypothesis that OA influences larval behavior, larval position was quantified using vertically-oriented, sealed UV-T tubes (4.5 cm ID, 68 cm long) suspended at shallow (0 m) and 3-m depth.

Over 24 h in high pCO~2~, larval position within these tubes varied among depths and time of day, following a gradual downward migration in shallow tubes and aggregating at ~3.4-m depth in the deeper tubes. Larvae in ambient pCO~2~ behaved similarly in deep tubes, but did not migrate downward in shallow tubes. Total lipid content of larvae declined 22-25% at high pCO~2~ but remained constant at ambient pCO~2~.

However, community development is dependent on numerous biotic and abiotic factors that can change over time and space, and the applicability of succession models is likely to vary. Variation in successional mode is expected over latitude, where numerous gradients in ecological processes and environmental factors exist, but the nature of this variation is not well understood. Over 20 degrees of latitude, we assessed the development of marine sessile invertebrate communities at 3-month intervals over 12 months, and compared developing communities with concurrent 3-month recruitment events. Community development fundamentally differed over latitude. In the tropics, community development was rapid, characterized by high temporal turnover that was recruitment driven. In temperate regions, community development was slower, temporal turnover decreased, communities were less affected by recruitment events and were more similar to initial recruitment. We propose that the mode of development shifts over latitude from a process where communities are replaced through stochastic recolonization, to a more deterministic succession. These results suggest that community assembly is more stochastic in the tropics and more deterministic at higher latitudes, possibly as a result of latitudinal differences in environmental filtering.",Community/Ecosystem Ecology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

At first glance, the effects of nutrients and herbivores on primary producers seem straightforward: the addition of limiting nutrients enhances producer abundance, whereas herbivores consume producers, reducing abundance. However, herbivores’ effects on primary producers are not limited to consumption. For example, molluscan grazers on rocky shores also enhance nutrient availability and microalgal recruitment, both of which have the potential to facilitate their algal resources. An understanding of the relative effects of consumers versus nutrients on primary producers is therefore incomplete without accounting for these top-down modifications of bottom-up processes. Here, we used a novel, field-based approach to evaluate the relative roles of herbivores’ top-down and bottom-up effects on microbial biofilms in tide pools. Initial observations in high-zone tide pools at Corona del Mar State Beach in Southern California revealed that both nutrient concentrations and photosynthetic biomass were higher in pools containing higher densities of molluscan grazers. We experimentally manipulated grazer abundances at the level of whole tide pools but controlled access of those grazers to experimental plots within each pool.

We conducted a study in field-deployed flow-through mesocosms to test the potential for food availability and diet to mitigate the effects of acidification on developing marine fouling communities. Food supply was supplemented with either *Thalassiosira* sp., a diatom with high concentration of fatty acids, *Tetraselmis* sp., a relatively lower quality green alga, or nothing. After twelve weeks, CO~2~ and diet had significant, additive effects on community structure. There was, however, high variation in response at the species-level to phytoplankton addition and its interaction with CO~2~. Availability of *Tetraselmis* sp. mitigated negative effects of acidification on abundance of schizoporellid bryozoans and ciliates. A dominant hydroid increased in abundance when fed *Thalassiosira* sp. under ambient conditions, but elevated CO~2~ appeared to eliminate the positive effect of this diet. This may be the result of indirect effects of CO~2~ via competition, as hydroids fed this diet displaced invasive ascidians only under ambient conditions. Invasive ascidians increased in abundance in response to CO~2~ across all food treatments. Overall, we demonstrate acidification poses a significant risk to marine communities and although one diet mediated effects of CO~2~ on some species, the interaction between another diet and acidification likely benefitted an invasive species, highlighting species interactions as key to understanding complex responses to acidification.",Community/Ecosystem Ecology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Coral colony size could play an important role in responding to P~CO2~ and temperature, because size affects mass transfer between tissue and seawater as well as the flow of seawater through the interstices among branches, within which chemical and physical conditions differ from ambient seawater. In one experiment, larger corals calcified at a slower size-specific rate, but calcification rate was unaffected by elevated temperature or P~CO2~. However, the relationship between respiration and colony size differed between temperature and P~CO2~ treatments. In another experiment, turbulence modified the scaling of calcification rate with colony size at 25°C, but less at 30°C.  Importantly, metrics of physiological performance measured using small coral nubbins provided inaccurate estimates of physiological performance of larger colonies. These results demonstrate the importance of colony size in modulating the response of branching corals to different temperature, P~CO2~, and turbulence regimes.

Despite a complete turnover in the host population, the average change in infection prevalence among populations was less than 1% over the 11 year span, and all but three populations remained within five percentage points.  This consistency of prevalence in each population over time suggests remarkable spatiotemporal constancy in parasite delivery vectors in this system, notably gulls that serve as definitive hosts for the parasites.  Thus, despite gulls’ high mobility, their habitat usage patterns are ostensibly relatively fixed in space.

Relative abundance on fixed index stations and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) continued to decline after quotas and effort were reduced. Recently, an entire fishery management area was closed due to low biomass estimate, and quotas in other areas have been further reduced. The theory that sea cucumber stocks in harvestable depths are replenished with recruits from deeper depths does not fit with observations in Washington. Sea cucumber stocks around the world have shown vulnerability to overharvest and recovery times on the order of decades, characteristics that seem to also apply to *Parastichopus*. Despite the depressed stocks, there is widespread anecdotal and quantitative evidence of unprecedented juvenile recruitment in 2014 - 2016 across the state – possibly as a result of predation release coinciding with the sea star wasting epidemic. Meanwhile, CPUE has increased over the last two seasons from an all-time low in 2013. There was also a small increase in relative abundance detected in fall 2015, which is a first in that time series’ 28-year history. A commitment by state and tribal co-managers to rigorous monitoring, responsible quotas, and a fishery closure during peak spawning months may pay dividends in future years.

Beyond incremental shifts in average temperature, climatic changes are also predicted to impact variation in thermal conditions. To address the biological consequences of thermal fluctuation, we measured growth in the mussel, Mytilus edulis, under stable water temperatures (15, 20, 25°C) and two fluctuating regimes (mean=20°C, range=15-25°C; fast fluctuation = full cycle every 6 hours, slow fluctuation = full cycle every 2 days). Under stable temperatures, growth was highest at 20°C and lower at 15 and 25°C. Rapidly fluctuation led to growth rates as high or, unexpectedly, higher than any stable temperature. Respiration rates also differed in stable versus fluctuating air temperatures with both a higher optimal temperature and maximum respiration rate under fluctuating conditions. Finally, RT-PCR analysis revealed that fluctuating water temperatures (mean=19°C, range=10-28°C, full cycle = 6 hours) promoted the expression of genes related to stress response (hsp70), cellular respiration (NADH), and cell division (APC7) relative to any stable temperature (10, 19, 28°C) over 5 days. However, mussels at 28°C experienced complete mortality by day 2, so their long-term expression was not measured.

This study used a small cosmopolitan brittlestar, *Amphipholis squamata* as a functional model for investigating effects of OA on the nervous system. Indeed, the species is capable of light production under nervous control, change of which thus being a sign of neuro-physiological impairment. We used a six-week pH treatment (pH levels: 8.02, 7.70, 7.40±.02) along which capacity of individuals to produce bioluminescence was characterized (1) under spontaneous conditions, and when stimulated (2) with acetylcholine neuro-mediator (ACh), and (3) potassium chloride (KCl) for assessment of chemical potential to produce light. Overall, our results show that spontaneous light was inhibited while ACh-stimulated light was amplified; KCl-stimulated light remained similar showing the same chemical ability. In *Amphipholis squamata*, the light production is regulated by the neuro-receptor GABA. This receptor has recently been proposed to be altered by OA conditions in rockfish, causing anxiety. Our study thus aligns well with previous observations on other organisms and represents the first direct demonstration of effects of OA on the nervous system.

Intraspecific differences in coral growth and tissue mortality between monocultures and polycultures were assessed after 4 and 16 months, as was total plot colonization by benthic macroalgae after 16 months. Corals exhibited up to 190% greater growth and 40% less tissue mortality when grown in polyculture compared to monoculture, while macroalgal biomass in polyculture was comparable to or less than monospecific plots. Coral growth in polyculture was also greater than (4 months) or equal to (16 months) growth in the most productive monoculture, suggesting that both selection and complementarity effects may be contributing to enhanced coral community performance.

The goal of this study was to shed some light on these processes by characterizing how blade shape varies across a full gradient of mechanical stress in the kelp *Nereocystis luetkeana*. Blades were hung from lines in the field with weights attached to mimic the effect of moving water. These weights ranged in mass from 28 to 112 g and a total of eight treatment levels were used. The morphology of the kelp blades was characterized at the beginning of the experiment and then each of the blades were left to grow subject to their respective levels of tensile stress for seven days. Morphology was characterized again at the end of the growth period and the change in length and width was calculated. It was found that blades grew more narrow at the proximal ends with increased weight application; this relationship appeared to be linear in nature. Furthermore, blades were observed to elongate more quickly with greater tensile stress in a similarly linear fashion.

They primarily struck the apex of high-spired snails (mean 58%) but the aperture of globular (mean 81%) and medium-spired snails (mean 74%). Corresponding to strike locations, most mantis shrimp fractured the shell enough to feed at the apex of high-spired snails (70%) and the aperture of globular (76%) and medium-spired snails (68%).

In both species, stable isotope values increased logarithmically with lens radius, possibly reflecting growth-related changes in trophic level. Comparisons of isotopic trends between species suggested that juvenile Graysby forage at a lower trophic level than young lionfish, but occupy a higher trophic position as adults. The strongest similarity in isotopic composition was measured in intermediate eye lens layers, indicating that interspecific resource use overlap may be greatest in mid-sized lionfish and Graysby. The shapes of isotopic chronologies were highly variable, potentially due to a combination of individual diet specialization and movements across isotopically variable environments. Isotopic records differed more among individual lionfish eye lenses, possibly indicating greater individual specialization and broader foraging ranges than Graysby.

This poses a problem for coralline algae because their calcified cell walls are rigid. Approximately 100 million years ago, crustose coralline algae evolved a key adaption – joints – that renders them flexible and has allowed the resulting articulated corallines to dominate space on some of Earth’s most wave-beaten coasts. The material from which these joints are constructed has unusual mechanical properties: it is eight times as extensible and four times are strong as typical algal tissue, and is immune to the fatigue that normally accompanies repeated impositions of force. In this talk, we report on new measurements of joint material properties: creep, the strain-rate dependence of stiffness, and the behavior of the material when subjected to cyclic loading. These measurements, when combined with previous information, allow us to formulate a simple model that explains how the chemical composition and macromolecular structure of cell-wall material accounts for the material’s unusual properties. We propose that cell wall material is a fiber-reinforced composite in which cellulose provides the fibers and a galactan gel forms the matrix. The fibers are not crosslinked, which allows the material to creep indefinitely, but the viscosity of the matrix ensures that the material is both elastic and strong when subjected to wave-induced fluid-dynamics forces.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Clams survived for more than 45 days at all salinities, except 60 ppt, when held at 10 C. Survival was lower at 20 C at all salinities. In a similar experiment, gill tissue was excised and acutely exposed to 1 – 60 ppt at 10 C and 20 C. Mortality was monitored over two weeks. Both salinity and temperature significantly affected tissue mortality. Gill tissue was surprisingly tolerant of very low salinities. At 10 C, gill tissue was able to survive more than a week at salinities from 1 to 40 ppt. We also found that *N. obscurata* osmoconforms at salinities from 10-50 ppt and is able to osmoregulate at 1 and 5 ppt. Gill tissue hydration remained relatively stable (80-90% water) over the range of salinities, indicating that *N. obscurata* is capable of regulating cell volume in hyperosmotic and hyposmotic environments. The broad salinity tolerance of *N. obscurata* is likely a key factor to its success in the high intertidal and in low salinity habitats, contributing to its rapid spread throughout the Salish Sea.",,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

The ∂^13^C signature of *M. pyrifera* tissue is an important potential tool for understanding species interactions within nearshore trophic networks. However, in macroalgae, ∂^13^C can vary widely, and M. pyrifera can differ up to 6‰ within a single individual, greatly complicating the designation of a primary end member. Abiotic factors such as irradiance, dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (DIC), water motion, and water temperature can drive ∂^13^C variation, either by altering the supply of total DIC available to individual tissues, or by inducing facultative carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs).  In this study, we combine a controlled laboratory experiment with field sampling to better understand and predict the abiotic drivers of ∂^13^C signatures in *M. pyrifera* tissues. We observed that the ∂^13^C of incubated tissue was strongly driven by irradiance, but not flow velocity or growth rates (a proxy for DIC consumption). This suggests that enrichment in *M. pyrifera* tissue is the result of a light-induced metabolic process. Field-collected samples supported a strong relationship between irradiance and ∂^13^C signatures, but indicated that DIC limitation was also important.

Ecology offers a uniquely important contribution because humanity’s interactions with nature centrally shape the long-term well-being of the biosphere that supports us. Realizing that contribution involves letting Homo sapiens into the club. This requires a rigorous, scientific natural history of people, linking our evolved traits and behaviors to socioeconomic interactions across scales, and building a rigorous, integrated ecology of human-dominated ecosystems. What about natural history? Detailed observation of organisms, immersive place-based knowledge, and integrative thinking must remain the foundation of ecology – indeed they are more important than ever. But ecological processes are changing rapidly on global as well as local scales and understanding them also requires comparative approaches unavailable to previous generations. Modern naturalists need to integrate place-based with global knowledge; field chops with modeling skills; community structure with governance structure. In contrast to the individualistic tradition of the intrepid explorer, the Anthropocene world needs naturalists that are more collaborative, quantitative, interdisciplinary, and solution-oriented, reflecting the highly connected world of the 21st century.

Susceptibility of black abalone to infection by WS is linked to higher body temperature (T~b~) variability during emersion, suggesting higher temperatures may threaten their persistence. Our research at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS) in Pacific Grove, CA, coupled a species-specific heat budget model with long-term meteorological records to investigate the environmental and topographic controls of abalone T~b~. Our model predicted that black abalone experience higher T~b~ on moderately sloping surfaces facing south to southwest and higher on the shore. Multivariate analyses revealed that high abalone T~b~ was produced by discrete combinations of environmental factors that differed within years, while exhibiting characteristic seasonal patterns among years. Lastly, incorporating previously published data linking disease risk to abalone T~b~, we found that spatial patterns of relative infection risk were similar to those of thermal stress, but only at the lowest modeled shore height. Due to the non-linear relationship between body temperature variability and infection risk, abalone higher on shore exhibited uniformly high risks of infection. Although abalone at HMS typically reside within crevices, presumably to avoid sea otter predation, increased use of such refuges may also confer an unexpected benefit to abalone by reducing their exposure to high T~b~ and associated risk of WS.",Organismal/Population Biology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

We hypothesized that the abundance of single-species clusters of palatable algae will be higher in areas of low herbivory pressure, but palatable algae in areas of high herbivory will exist only in mixes with unpalatable species. We quantified frequency of mixes and single-species clusters of algae from surveys (n=90, 25x25cm photoquadrats) carried out during summer 2015 in six reefs in the Upper Florida Keys. To identify the role of herbivory, we analyzed a time series photo set (0 months, 6 months, 12 months) of a year-long herbivore exclusion experiment (summer 2014-2015) at Pickles Reef. In the photo set data, we found that one reef site with high herbivory had more *Dictyota*-*Jania* spp. mixes than all other sites, which had either high or low herbivory pressure. *Jania* did not exist outside of mixes with *Dictyota* spp.; therefore, it is likely that *Dictyota* spp. serves as a refuge from herbivory.

Although increases in mean temperature are predicted to decrease body size (i.e., the temperature-size rule), an alternative suggests that increased variability will increase body size because desiccation stress during exceptionally warm periods can select for larger individuals. We tested these hypotheses using historical data on three gastropods (*Chlorostoma funebralis*, *Lottia digitalis*, *Littorina keenae*) spanning an intertidal range of 0-8m above mean lower low water.

However, *L. keenae* in the high intertidal, which is never submerged by seawater, increased in size. The tidal variation in body size change supports the temperature-size rule because environmental records indicated that while seawater has warmed over the past six decades, air temperature has in fact declined.

Magnesium content varies between individuals and could be a mechanism for acclimation for algae recruiting to harsh environments. To test this hypothesis, we collected *Corallina officinalis* from tide pools that experience extreme daily variation and from a  site that experiences lower daily variation in seawater pH.

In contrast *C. officinalis* collected from the flushed site had no response to pCO~2~ treatments but had significantly lower growth overall. Tide pool two showed higher inclusion of magnesium in its carbonate skeleton which could explain its more pronounced response to the pCO~2~ treatments.

In the Northeast Pacific Ocean, differences in the strength of oceanic upwelling cause latitudinal variation in pH that is hypothesized to promote local adaptation and unequal pH tolerance among resident populations. In this study, responses to experimental seawater acidification were compared among six populations of purple sea urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) inhabiting areas that differ in their frequency of low pH exposure and that prior research suggests are locally adapted to seawater pH. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate populations most frequently exposed to low pH seawater respond to experimental acidification by expressing genes within ATP producing pathways at greater levels than populations encountering low pH less often. Multiple genes within the tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and fatty acid oxidation pathways were up-regulated in urchin populations experiencing low pH conditions most frequently. These same metabolic pathways are over-represented among genes both expressed in a population-specific manner and putatively under selection to enhance low pH tolerance.

This study examined the effects of instrument attachment and removal on the pelts of northern fur seals, which rely primarily on their fur for insulation in water. To assess the extent to which water is able to penetrate the air layer of fur seal pelts during diving, we measured the volume of air released under the hydrostatic pressure of simulated dives.

We also measured the thermal conductivity of unmodified and modified pelts in water for both methods of instrumentation. Cutting of the fur during tag removal allowed for water to penetrate the fur under pressure and reduced the thermal function of the pelt in water.

To understand the potential consequences of wave action on the common triplefin (Forsterygion lapillum), we quantified wave-induced water flow on the Wellington south coast and evaluated corresponding morphological variation. We found that fish tended to be larger at sites, depths, and seasons with greater water flow. Since environmental stress models predict that food web interactions depend on the intensity and frequency of environmental stress, we conducted a lab experiment to investigate if changes in feeding behaviour underlie disturbance-induced variation in morphology. We placed triplefin into experimental mesocosms, with varying densities of prey, and used a system of automated ‘dump buckets’ to create disturbance, recovery, or calm wave action treatments.  Across all densities, triplefin consumed the highest proportion of prey in calm conditions and the lowest proportion of prey in disturbance conditions, with attack rates halving in wavy conditions.

Adults require access to cool water patches (thermal refuges) during in-river residence to avoid mortality and retain sufficient energy for spawning. We examined thermal refuge use by adult Atlantic salmon during summer 2016 in the Northeast Sainte-Marguerite River, (Quebec, Canada). We used airborne thermal infrared (TIR) imagery to identify refuges and deployed acoustic receivers inside and outside of refuges to assess use. We measured fish temperature using acoustic transmitters equipped with temperature sensors (N=20) and recorded river temperature with data loggers. Refuge use began at river temperatures of 18-19○C but was greatest when river temperature exceeded the upper critical temperature for Atlantic salmon (22-23○C). During refuge use, fish temperature was as much as 4.7○C cooler than ambient river temperature. Interestingly, fish sought out warm water patches at lower river temperatures (14-16○C). Mapping via TIR only identified small refuges projecting to the surface, which while abundant, were not frequently used. The most heavily used refuges were large, stable, thermally stratified pools that were not identified by the TIR survey. Our findings highlight the importance of combining aerial and ground-based methods to identify suitable thermal refuges. Maintaining access to such large, stable refuges may be crucial for persistence of Atlantic salmon within their North American range given current climate change scenarios that predict warmer, drier summers.",Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

However, even the most robust studies attribute less than half of observed species distributions to local climate change. Foundational ecology considers climate as just one of many drivers that determine species distributions, in addition to biogeography, biotic interactions, and other abiotic factors. This study unifies evidence and theory for how shifting species distributions in the Anthropocene are influenced by (1) natural and anthropogenic biogeographic barriers to dispersal and other biogeographic features, (2) biotic interactions such as competition, predation, and mutualism, and (3) abiotic factors including light, pH, nutrients, and other resources. It also provides concrete and testable hypotheses for how biogeography, biotic interactions, and abiotic factors might be detected in Anthropocene species distributions, based on species traits. These hypotheses can be used to identify the signature of multiple drivers of species distributions in empirical data, and their relative importance in setting range edges. This work supports conservation initiatives for threatened species by identifying the processes that most crucially limit their potential redistribution, and can inform more ecologically realistic species distribution models that incorporate multiple processes rather than climate alone.",Community/Ecosystem Ecology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

We have since documented multiple pulses of new settler cohorts in still images from follow-up dives and ROV videos from the spring and summer of 2016. These observations, paired with a series of anecdotes of similar observations since 2005, suggest that dense aggregations of *C. magister* recruits on the outer coast may be common. However, the biology and ecology of this phenomenon are virtually unstudied. We know from 16 years of light trap sampling of crab megalopae within the Coos Bay estuary that the annual larval abundance delivered to the nearshore regularly varies among years by a factor of 1000. Interestingly, 2016 is a strong El Nino year, with very low total megalopae abundance. Here, we summarize density and size information of recruits gathered from diving, ROV videos, and personal observations, in the context of the long-term light trap megalopae data. Pulses of megalopae represent a lipid and energy rich biomass transfer from the open ocean to the coast. The biomass of settlers in April, estimated based on size and mass relationships, was ~1 kg/m^2^. Settlement pulses likely occur twice monthly, hence, over spring/summer ~8 kg/m^2^ of open ocean derived biomass may be delivered to the coast. Such settlement events likely provide an energetic subsidy to consumers, intense competition, cannibalism, and predation upon benthic communities, which could profoundly affect rocky subtidal ecosystems.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Although vital to predicting how parasitism will respond to climate change, thermal responses of both host and parasite in key traits affecting transmission have rarely been quantified.  Through temperature-controlled experiments on an ectothermic host-parasite system, we demonstrate an offset in the thermal optima for survival of infected and uninfected hosts, and parasite production. We combined experimentally-derived thermal performance curves with field data on seasonal host abundance and parasite prevalence to parameterize an epidemiological model and forecast the dynamical responses to plausible future climate warming scenarios. In all scenarios we predicted a dramatic decline in parasite prevalence, with local parasite extinction predicted with as little as 2º C mean warming.

Non-consumptive, indirect effects can alter ecosystem function by influencing habitat use, prey physiological characteristics, and biotic interactions. These indirect interactions can have large effects, yet are understudied in the context of restoration. We explored how predators impact crab distributions in the intertidal zone, and potential consequences of the resulting distributional shifts on restoration efforts of the native cordgrass (*Spartina foliosa*) in San Francisco Bay. We found that the non-native crab *Carcinus maenas*, which is rarely found at high tidal elevations elsewhere, has an atypical distribution in the Bay in which it is more common at high elevations. Perceived threat from subtidal predators at low tidal elevations may cause *C. maenas* to seek refuge in high tidal elevations, including in restored cordgrass habitat where their foraging activity may cause damage. Crab distribution and predation on crabs were quantified using trapping and tethering experiments across tidal elevations. We then evaluated the effects of crab activity within *S. foliosa* patches using a field enclosure experiment, caging cordgrass with and without crabs to assess impacts on cordgrass growth and survival. This work has direct implications for management by revealing how interactions between multiple trophic levels can confound restoration efforts.

At night, the fish forages near the reef while emitting bacterial light along its ventrum and returns to a host urchin at dawn where the fish releases excess symbiont cells daily as waste. To examine the role of the host’s ecology in genetically structuring populations of its symbiont and promoting the specificity of the symbiosis, we used double-digest restriction site associated sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to define patterns of genetic structure of both the host and symbiont. Analysis of >10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 300 host fish from 11 locations in Okinawa, Japan over 3 years yielded low F~ST~ values and no evidence of structure at spatial scales ranging from a few to one hundred kilometers. In contrast, analysis of >600 polymorphic loci in the bacterial genome yielded distinct genetic structure at spatial scales between 40 and 100 kilometers. The lack of population structure in the host implies that *S. tubifer* larvae can disperse substantial distances during their pelagic phase, promoting genetic admixture. In contrast, the presence of genetic structure in the symbiont suggests that larval hosts acquire their luminous bacteria from a locally enriched pool near a host population at a settlement site. The ecology of the host is therefore helping to shape the biogeographic patterns of its bacterial symbiont and maintain symbiont specificity over host generations.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

We investigated changes in metabolism and structure of *B. nubilus* muscle in response to: normoxic immersion, anoxic immersion, or air emersion, for acute (6h) or chronic (6h exposures twice daily for 2wk) time periods. Following exposure, we immediately measured hemolymph pO~2~, then excised tergal depressor (TD; glycolytic) and scutal adductor (SA; oxidative) muscles to determine citrate synthase (CS) activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and D-lactate. We also prepared a subset of SA and TD muscles from the chronic barnacles for histological analysis of fiber diameter (Feret’s), cross-sectional area (CSA), and myonuclear domain size. There was a decrease in hemolymph pO~2~ following 6h of anoxia, though not emersion, and this effect was more pronounced in the chronic experiment. Myonuclear domain size in SA muscle was significantly lower in the anoxic and emersion groups than the normoxic control and both muscles had significantly higher D-lactate levels after air emersion following acute exposure.

These ‘traditional’ methods were immensely successful for gaining insight into the value and sensitivity of complex coastal ecosystems. 

Nowadays, we are required to investigate ‘applied’ ecological effects, at ever-finer spatial and temporal scales. Practitioners have a host of options for survey design and analysis. The next generation of ecologists will likely work with data collected by robots, species identified by software, and complex models generated from the press of a button. But is it really worth it? Can’t we just adapt our sampling methods (and research budgets) to the next generation of analyses? And what can we do with this new 'big data’ once we have it? 

This talk will focus on the relative effectiveness of contemporary, spatially-driven methods for making observations, and assessing impacts, in sub-tidal marine systems. We will present an analytical comparison of ‘traditional’ quadrat-and-transect surveys with contemporary, semi-automatically generated data from benthic photographs. Using GRTS spatially-balanced sampling designs, and a USBL underwater positioning system, we efficiently modelled the spatial effects of urbanisation on soft-sediment, temperate reef, and threatened seagrass meadow communities.

However, forecasting ecosystem changes is difficult due to variation among species and individuals in their response to this stressor. Many OA studies extrapolate the response of one population to the entire species, but a single population may not be representative if the species spans a heterogeneous geographic range. This study compares the response of two populations of the coral, *Balanophyllia elegans* from California, to future OA conditions. These two populations experience distinct upwelling regimes, which bring acidic water to the surface. To endure upwelling, populations of *B. elegans* must be plastic to fluctuating pH, but the lower limits of their pH tolerance may differ according to their environment’s upwelling regime. We measured respiration rates in corals from both populations exposed to *p*CO~2~ levels of 750 and 2000 µatm for four weeks. Corals from the northern population, which experience lower pH in their natural habitat, maintained the same respiration rate throughout the exposure, suggesting resilience to future pH levels. In contrast, corals from the southern population showed an increase in respiration rate throughout the exposure to low pH, suggesting an increased metabolic demand.

Pups are born in June, nurse discontinuously for ~4-5 months, then wean. Their cryptic, pelagic foraging makes NFS ideal candidates for the use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) which has been used to describe foraging behaviors and habitat uses of adults and juveniles. Because pups rely on their mother’s milk before weaning, we assumed their SI values would reflect a higher trophic level than that of their mothers throughout their nursing period. As pups switch to a likely diet of small, mesopelagic fish, we expected to see lower stable nitrogen isotope values (δ^15^N) in pup tissues after weaning. To determine the detectability of this isotopic shift, we collected vibrissae, milk, liver, and serum samples from pups throughout their nursing period (Sept, n=5; Oct, n=31; Nov, n=21) during the annual subsistence harvest on St. George Island, Alaska. NFS vibrissae grow throughout their lifetimes, so SIA of vibrissae segments allowed for a chronological measure of pup diet from in-utero to weaning, whereas SI values from liver and serum provided assimilated diet data from the week previous to sample collection. We compared SI values from pup tissues to those from NFS milk and other prey collected from their stomachs to better determine how well SIA predicted weaning.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster"

Biofilms of the bacterium *Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea* stimulate settlement of *H. elegans* by releasing complex arrays of tubular organelles derived from phage-tail genes. However, another common biofilm bacterium, *Cellulophaga lytica*, lacks the genes coding for the phage-tail arrays and appears to stimulate settlement when larvae of *H. elegans* contact spherical membrane vesicles released from the bacteria. Other stimulatory bacterial species appear to lack both mechanisms, indicating that larvae of *H. elegans* respond to multiple bacterial structures, and perhaps stimulatory molecules, by settling, attaching and undergoing metamorphosis. Although *H. elegans* is a species typically found in enclosed bays and harbors, such as Pearl Harbor, HI, where it can coat pilings and ship hulls, settlement assays on biofilms collected from other marine habitats in Hawaii were also found to stimulate settlement of its larvae.

We have observed that these brittle stars show regular, cyclic expansion and contraction of their body discs with periods of 1.1 to 6 minutes (depending on the individual).  From measurements of the height and width of the body disc, we estimated that disc volume increases by 21% (range 8 to 44% across individuals) during the expansion phase of the cycle.

Results from blood serum assays (IgG and IgM) have shown that 16% of California sea lions and northern fur seals with respiratory symptoms at California marine mammal rehabilitation facilities have antibodies against coccidioides. With these results in mind, we evaluated a coccidioidomycosis diagnostic tool never before used on marine mammals: SPHERUSOL. SPHERUSOL is an intradermal mitogen test used to detect antibodies to Coccidioides in humans. We compared immunodiffusion assays on blood serum of sea lion and fur seal patients at the Marine Mammal Center with the results of SPHERUSOL skin tests to validate the skin test for use on pinnipeds. This test could potentially diagnose coccidioidomycosis in pinnipeds before dissemination, and expedite treatment with anti-fungal agents for a better prognosis.

The overharvesting, protection and subsequent recovery of pinnipeds is globally well documented, but the ecological effects of the recovery of these aggregating, higher-order predators on temperate reef biota is understudied. We investigated key trophic interactions involving two sympatric pinniped predators, Australian and long-nosed fur seals (*Actocephalus* spp.) using a multi-disciplinary approach. DNA-based methods were used to analyse predator diets across multiple locations of recolonization on the south coast of NSW, Australia. This was combined with diver surveys of temperate reef communities to evaluate the potential for localized effects of predators on temperate reef communities. We found considerable overlap of key prey groups in the diets of both seal species at the most peripheral haul-out site and strong trophic linkages with coastal ecosystems, in contrast with the diet composition of both seal species observed from the breeding colony. These results suggest there may be different trophic interactions at newly recolonized sites compared to established colonies, with different outcomes for temperate reef communities.

The cause of this decline is unknown, as are the consequences for the estuarine community that was once supported by abundant eelgrass. Here, we focus on the impact of eelgrass decline on the avian community through analysis of annual Christmas Bird Counts. We compared terrestrial and coastal bird abundances and compositions before and after eelgrass decline in Morro Bay. While terrestrial bird abundance and composition did not change, coastal bird abundances declined overall, and composition shifted. A PERMANOVA revealed that annual temperature and precipitation had no effect, whereas eelgrass decline explained the most variability in coastal bird community composition. Principal component analysis indicated that the community difference was driven largely by a decline in Brant geese, which are obligate herbivores dependent on eelgrass. Some generalist species, such as sandpipers and ruddy ducks, increased after the eelgrass decline, suggesting that foraging guild may predict species response to eelgrass loss.

Field experiments revealed that in protected salt marshes experiencing a severe drought, planting-eating grazers eliminated drought-stressed vegetation that could otherwise survive and recover from the climate extreme, transforming once lush marshes into persistent salt barrens. A global survey further showed that pressure from natural enemies potentially exacerbated the loss of resilience to drought in at least 58% of the reported drought-associated vegetation mortality events across biomes.

The recovery of sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) in the north Pacific is a prime example of how the conservation of top predators can lead to range expansion into perceived “novel” habitats, with unexpected benefits to threatened ecosystems. Using a two-year predator exclusion experiment and two decades of monitoring we show how the recovery of sea otters can suppress crab-generated erosion and dieback in shoreline-protecting salt marshes in a central California estuary, Elkhorn Slough. In this system, hydrological modifications coupled with expansive burrowing and herbivory by crabs (*Pachygrapsus crassipes*) have caused massive bank erosion for over 50 years. The last decade of recovery of sea otters has resulted in their expansion along bank edges of salt marshes (primarily the pickleweed *Salicornia pacifica*), where they consume burrowing crabs and use the marsh to haul out. The removal of crabs by sea otters leads to reduced burrowing, greater marsh biomass, and potentially enhanced shoreline stability. Long-term monitoring suggests that this trophic cascade has contributed to the suppression of shoreline erosion, which has been reduced by 50% since sea otter recolonization of salt marshes.

We examined the effects of crab predation on Mytilus in the absence of Pisaster predation by re-locating stars and transplanting mussels to different tidal heights on a rocky shore in Northern California. When transplanted at low tidal elevations, uncaged mussels showed increased mortality compared to caged mussels at low elevations, and caged and uncaged transplanted mussels at high elevations. Crab attacks on wax snail replicas confirmed mortality on mussels at low elevations were due to crab predation. Both caged and uncaged mussels transplanted to high tidal elevations also experienced mortality, but this was due to disturbance from strong wave forces.

The goal of this study was to determine if species with different life histories showed responses to protection within young MPAs in Southern California. We measured the difference in size structure of fishes between protected and unprotected areas with diver-operated stereo-video cameras.

To protect rocky intertidal biota, certain locations have been designated Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Intertidal MPAs can be ineffective because public compliance and knowledge of regulations has been low. To help increase public knowledge of MPA regulations, 2 outreach tools have been instituted in Newport Beach, CA: a tidepool interpretive program with educators on site; and the ISOpod (Interactive Sealife Outreach pod) mobile touch tank, parked on site for visitors to see/touch organisms in a controlled setting. The goal of this project is to examine effectiveness of both tools in reducing deleterious activities. Visitors were discretely observed, counted, and placed into categories (e.g. collecting, handling) during surveys under 4 scenarios based on presence/absence of the ISOpod and educators. A questionnaire was conducted with departing visitors to determine if MPA regulations knowledge increases with outreach programs. Percent of visitors engaged in all detrimental activities combined decreased by 1/2 when the ISOpod or educators were present as compared to no outreach program; no combined effect was observed. The patterns for the individual activities were less consistent. Public knowledge of MPA regulations were relatively high with patterns of higher knowledge when either the ISOpod or educators were in place. Results from this study will elucidate whether these tools are an effective option to help protect coastal ecosystems.",Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Buoyant plumes of warm water rising from vents are believed to transport the larvae of invertebrate animals into deep-ocean currents that can potentially carry them to nascent habitats along the mid-ocean ridge axes. Yet, sampling the vertical distribution and abundance of these larvae has been difficult. Recent MBARI expeditions to explore newly discovered vents in the southern Gulf of California provided an opportunity to improve the targeting of water column samples and efficiency of larval identifications. Suction samplers on the ROV Doc Ricketts were used to filter seawater in situ at various depths above hydrothermal vents. Next Generation Sequencing was used to identify sampled larvae to the species-level. Despite close proximity, the species composition of adult animals at vent communities in the Pescadero Basin (~3800 m depth) and on the Alarcon Rise (~2300 m) differed dramatically from one-another and from a neighboring hydrocarbon seep community on the Pescadero Transform Fault (2400 m). The larval sampling and DNA sequencing identified the larvae of several species within the visible hydrothermal plumes and also outside of the plumes at various depths.

However, a recent study of *Pisaster* populations in British Columbia suggests that these differences may be due to phenotypically plastic changes in body shape through the uptake or discharge of seawater. That study observed a positive relationship between ossicle density and wave-induced changes in star aspect ratio: aboral ossicle density tended to increase with increasing aspect ratio (an adaptive plastic response to increased flow conditions) as would be expected if sea star shape is achieved through deflation. Here, we examined whether the density and pattern of aboral ossicles in Northern California populations of *Pisaster* were correlated with spatial and seasonal variation in wave exposure in a manner consistent with flow-induced plasticity. We found that aboral ossicle density was significantly higher in stars at wave-exposed sites and during storm season when wave force is maximal; consistent with previous findings. However, we also found that variation in ossicle density was decoupled from variation in arm aspect ratio, which is inconsistent with previous findings.

I asked this question in a tropical invertebrate community, where severe salinity disturbances are expected to follow an upsurge in large storms. I used field-deployed settlement panels and predator exclusion treatments, combined with a laboratory-based low-salinity treatment mimicking conditions typical of severe storms, to examine how fish predators might alter the impact of disturbance on sessile assemblages. The low-salinity event drove large shifts in species composition for communities assembled without predators, accompanied by an average 34% loss of pre-disturbance biomass after a one-month recovery period. In contrast, communities open to predators during the 3-month assembly period showed no effect of the low-salinity event on community structure or biomass (up 22% relative to pre-disturbance). Results indicate that, by controlling a high-biomass invader, predation prior to the event conferred resistance to disturbance-driven changes in biomass and species composition.

From 2009-2013, we found *Pisaster* was the most abundant sea star, making up to 99% of the sea star community. However, winter surveys from 2015 to 2016 showed *Evasterias* made up to 80% of the community. In a salinity tolerance experiment, *Pisaster* and *Evasterias* performance overlapped, but *Evasterias* showed greater activity than *Pisaster* at higher salinity. During a six week competition experiment, *Evasterias* grew faster in the presence of *Pisaster* than in the presence of other *Evasterias*. Furthermore, *Evasterias* presence reduced *Pisaster* growth. When in the presence of mussels, *Evasterias* consumed more than *Pisaster*. Such results contradict the common conception of *Pisaster* as the dominant sea star.

Dual systematic and focal follow surveys were conducted in a British Columbia fjord system to compare prey preferences and thresholds in two sympatric rorquals, humpbacks (*Megaptera novaengliae*) and fin whales (*Balaenoptera physalus*). Humpback response to prey features was less predictable and influenced by more factors than that of fin whales, who appeared to be exclusively euphausivorous and interested predominantly in the deepest high-volume krill-like backscatter patches within the deepest channels. Compared to fin whales, humpbacks found higher integrated backscatter and had higher aggregative thresholds, but had lower feeding thresholds. Findings aligned overall with the expectations that aggregative behavior is responsive to local prey supply while feeding thresholds are governed by the less mutable energetic constraints imposed by body size and feeding mode. For both threshold types, their response curve appeared to be a function of local conditions: as total krill-like backscatter increased, aggregative thresholds stabilized (became more nonlinear and more nonrandom), while aggregative thresholds destabilized.

We sampled crab population demographics in fixed upper and lower intertidal zone transects at Fort Ross, CA. The density of crabs was lower in the warmer high intertidal zone and doubled in the cooler low intertidal zone. Further warming may exacerbate these effects and lead to physiological stress. In the lab, we examined physiological stress caused by high density and competition using differential expression of six biomarkers for the cellular stress response (CSR). Increased density correlated with increased expression of the CSR. When observed in single and mixed species groups, crabs were more interactive in interspecific groups, but interaction frequency did not affect CSR.

We found that shears, accelerations, and odor concentrations encountered by small swimmers fluctuate rapidly, with peaks much higher than mean values lasting fractions of a second. We identified ways in which the behavior of small, weak swimmers can bias how they are transported by ambient flow (e.g. sinking during brief encounters with shear or odor enhances settlement onto substrata below, whereas constant swimming enhances contact with surfaces above or beside larvae).

Three months after initial clipping, clipped plants of all genotypes had both reduced shoot density and leaf-extension rates relative to un-clipped plants. However, the magnitude of the clipping effect varied considerably among genotypes and was lowest in genotypes with greater allocation to belowground storage. These genotype-by-environment effects suggest that eelgrass populations have a strong adaptive potential for plasticity in response to clipping stress and that plasticity in resource allocation is an important trait in the resilience of eelgrass to grazing disturbance. Future work will assess variation in resistance traits among eelgrass genotypes using field-based assays.",Organismal/Population Biology,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster"

While evidence supports this prediction among colonizing plants and animals, few studies have investigated shifts in reproductive mode in haploid-diploid species, in which there are both prolonged haploid and diploid stages. Moreover, in these life cycles, asexual reproduction can yield the dominance of either haploid or diploid individuals. We tested for shifts in ploidy and reproductive mode across native and introduced populations of the red seaweed *Gracilaria vermiculophylla*. Native populations in the northwest Pacific Ocean were nearly always attached by holdfasts to hard substrata and were composed of haploids and diploids. In contrast, along North American and European coastlines, introduced populations nearly always floated atop soft-sediment mudflats, were overwhelmingly dominated by diploid thalli without holdfasts and exhibited population genetic signals consistent with extensive vegetative fragmentation. The ecological shift from attached to unattached thalli, ostensibly necessitated by the invasion of soft-sediment habitats, correlated with shifts from sexual to asexual reproduction during three distinct invasions along North American and European coastlines. A labile mating system likely facilitates colonization success and subsequent range expansion in haploid-diploid species, but the long-term eco-evolutionary impacts will depend on which ploidy stage is lost and the degree to which asexual reproduction is canalized.",N/A,,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

This project aims to determine if *M. pyrifera* individuals from different populations exhibit similar zoospore settlement in warming conditions.

Using a high speed video camera (at ≥1000 frames/sec), we recorded power and recovery strokes of appendages on tethered and free swimming cyprids and analyzed movement and velocities of appendages and setae. Thoracic limbs show a metachronal beat that starts with posterior most appendages and moves anteriorly.

Here, through adopting novel techniques, we endeavoured to understand how artificial structures, specifically boating infrastructure, interact over fine spatial scales with multiple components of the ecosystem. We used an ultra-short baseline (USBL) underwater acoustic positioning system, often used for deep-sea exploration, and a generalised random tessellation stratified (GRTS) sampling design to gather highly accurate underwater spatial data (<20 cm accuracy). To understand the ranging spatial effects of boating infrastructure we contrasted developed locations to undeveloped locations, as well as looking within the developed locations to assess fine-scale ecological responses in Sydney Harbour, Australia, a highly urbanised estuary and the gateway to Australia’s largest city.

Historically, marine habitats around the Channel Islands were well surveyed by scuba divers to a depth of 20 meters, but the deeper waters remained poorly studied. Together, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) developed a long-term Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program to monitor changes over time. ROV configuration, survey design and protocols, and data post processing and analysis techniques were developed to evaluate how marine populations respond to establishment of a MPA network.
To document the ecological condition of Channel Islands MPAs, the ROVs were configured to capture both fish and invertebrate data concurrently. Each ROV was equipped with both forward and downward facing video cameras, to provide a continuous view in front of and below the ROV. Acoustic tracking was used to geo-reference the imagery. Transect width and length were used to calculate species densities.

Field and laboratory experiments reveal the fitness consequences of variation in gamete recognition proteins as a function of sperm availability.  Field studies estimate the likelihood that sperm from different males compete for fertilization with single eggs, which sets the stage for the possibility that sexual conflict drives the evolution of these reproductive proteins.  Field surveys provide evidence for how sperm and egg protein allele frequencies have shifted over an estimated 200 year time interval correlated with the extirpation of predatory sea otters that likely severely constrained sea urchin abundances.  Patterns of shifting allele frequencies match expectations based on allele specific sperm and egg compatibilities and the presence of sexual conflict.  Evidence suggests that with increasing sea urchin abundances, rare and less compatible egg genotypes became increasingly more successful as an escape from the likelihood of polyspermy.  This facilitated increases in a formerly rare sperm protein allele that is compatible with the newly common egg protein.  The results suggest that reproductive traits can evolve quickly to match new demographic conditions and that shifts in abundances might cause alternating patterns of purifying versus diversifying selection that might drive patterns of reproductive isolation and speciation.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Underlying the squid’s locomotion are two parallel motor-nerve pathways, the giant and non-giant axon systems, which can act individually or in concert to coordinate jetting. Because squids cannot thermoregulate and they have a high oxygen demand to sustain muscular activity, maintaining essential behaviors amidst environmental variation poses a major challenge. *Doryteuthis opalescens* (California market squid) found in Monterey Bay often encounters intrusions of cold, hypoxic water from offshore, but effects of hypoxia on locomotion and its underlying mechanisms in this species remain unexplored. In this study, we elicited escape jets using a strobe-flash stimulus and recorded stellar nerve activity along with pressure inside the mantle cavity in restrained squid exposed to normoxia (&gt;250 &mu;M &asymp; 8 mg/L) and acute hypoxia (60 &mu;M &asymp; 2 mg/L) at 8&deg;C. Escape jet amplitude was lower and latency was longer under hypoxic conditions, but only for individuals exposed to hypoxia before normoxia. Squid exposed to normoxia followed by hypoxia did not show these differences, but they did show increased latency and decreased jet amplitude upon return to normoxia. The longer latency and lower jet amplitude appear to coincide with reduced giant axon activity. These results suggest that exposure to hypoxia may primarily affect locomotor performance in *D. opalescens* by impairing giant axon activity.",Organismal/Population Biology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

However, as *Nereocystis* grows, pneumatocysts are exposed to significant changes in hydrostatic pressure. Exposure to changing hydrostatic pressure could cause complications since the pneumatocyst is filled with gases that may expand or contract, potentially causing these structures to break and no longer be buoyant. This study explored how pneumatocysts resist biomechanical stress and keep the developing sporophyte upright in the water. Throughout development, pneumatocysts had an internal pressure consistently less than atmospheric pressure, indicating pneumatocysts always experience compressional loads. The structural integrity and design of the pneumatocyst to resist buckling was assessed by measuring compressional modulus (material stiffness), calculating material stress, analyzing critical geometry, and measuring critical buckling pressure. Young sporophytes found at depth with small pneumatocysts were demonstrated to have reached a critical size in development and are at greatest risk of buckling. Pneumatocysts do not adjust material properties or geometry to reduce wall stress, but are naturally resistant to hydrostatic loads. Critically small pneumatocysts buckled around 35m depth, which was observed to be sporophytes’ lower limit in the field.

The length of time these larvae are in the plankton (planktonic larval duration) can affect larval dispersal and mortality. One factor that can affect planktonic larval duration is larval feeding. Larval feeding rates are commonly measured in homogenous suspensions of edible particles, but natural plankton also contains large inedible (LI) particles that cannot be ingested (e.g. some dinoflagellates and diatoms). Hansen et al. (1991) demonstrated that feeding rates of molluscan veligers are lower when LI beads are present at very high concentrations (1,000-20,000•ml^-1^). We hypothesized that LI particles at environmentally realistic concentrations reduce feeding rates of echinoderm larvae. Larvae of a holothuroid, two asteroids, and three echinoids were permitted to feed briefly on 6 µm beads alone, or in combination with LI beads at concentrations of 25, 50, 100 or 500•ml^-1^. Five of the six species had a dose-dependent decrease in larval feeding rate when exposed to LI beads. Specifically, larval feeding decreased by ~50% in treatments of LI beads at 100 or 500•ml^-1^. In the presence of LI beads, larvae may alter their swimming behavior or engage in particle rejection behavior; either activity might reduce the time larvae would otherwise spend feeding.

Abalone displayed a 40% reduction in shell growth under acidified conditions, with no effect of a 2°C increase.

Therefore the realistic effects of hypoxia on species interactions in open-coast upwelling systems, such as California kelp forests, are not well known. We focused on the responses of sea urchins due to their key grazing role in kelp forests. We examined respiration and grazing rates of purple sea urchins under ambient conditions, low temperature, low DO, and combined low temperature and DO (upwelling).

Sea urchin metabolic rates and grazing rates were negatively and additively impacted by low temperature and low DO. We also found that urchin respiration rates tracked DO fluctuations in the intermittent-exposure treatment, whereas they decreased but recovered in the constant exposure treatment, such that integrated grazing rates were similar in both exposure regimes.

Our need for solutions was particularly pressing not only because we release global scores annually but because we also share instruction, data, and code with independent groups leading OHI assessments within their own coastal jurisdictions. Thankfully, we discovered that freely available tools exist to improve reproducibility, collaboration, and communication for teams working with data, text, and code; we call these ‘open science tools’. During the past three years, we have incrementally introduced open science tools and practices into our workflow, primarily using R, RStudio, and Github. These tools have fundamentally changed our approach to science. We find that scientists elsewhere are eager to implement open science concepts, but may not have been exposed to the necessary tools available to suit their needs or lack the knowledge and confidence to begin using them.

In this study, I look at the short term effects of sediment augmentation on vegetation and invertebrate communities following the addition of sediment in the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge in Southern California. Abiotic measurements, invertebrate cores, and plant physiology were analyzed before and after sediment augmentation in a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design. The wetland is dominated by three main habitat types 1) *Spartina foliosa* 2) *Batis maritima* and 3) ponds or standing water. Immediately following sediment augmentation, there was a significant decrease in plant cover and invertebrate abundance in the augmentation site. There was also a significant change in the community composition of plants within *Spartina* and *Batis* habitats and a significant difference in the community composition of invertebrates within all habitat types. I expect that through time invertebrate and vegetation communities will recover until they reflect pre-augmentation levels, although the invertebrate community will be slower to respond than the plant community.

Responses to predator densities in the field were similar to those reported in mesocosms. Whelks from sites with higher crab density had thicker, wider shells that combat crushing; whelks from sites with higher sea star density had elongate, high-spired shells that combat shell entry. Further research is needed to rule out locally adapted genetic variation between sites; however, *N. lamellosa’s* plastic response to non-consumptive predator effects in the field parallels the difference in shell shape determined in mesocosm experiments, implying that predator-induced phenotypic plasticity is possibly driving patterns of morphological variation in nature.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster"

The magnitude of post-SSWS recruitment of the ochre star *Pisaster ochraceus* varied substantially between regions. Oregon and northern California have experienced historically unprecedented recruitment, while in central California, pulses of recruits arrived but had low survival rates. Using growth rates from pre-SSWS long term monitoring and arm length data from *P. ochraceus* populations at eight intertidal sites in California and Oregon in 2015-2016, we determined what proportion of recruits at each site arrived during the SSWS outbreak or are from the generation after the mass mortality. Because body size influences sea stars’ predatory capabilities, we used a size-biomass relationship to compare pre- and post-SSWS biomass densities as another metric of recovery. Compared to California, Oregon sites had higher proportions of sea stars recruiting one generation after the outbreak.

The sea urchin *Lytechinus variegatus* is known to exhibit variation in color within populations. Here we examine patterns of reproductive compatibility and aggregation, and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) based on color.  Results indicate that laboratory crosses of urchins within color morphs yielded higher fertilization success than crosses between color morphs. Field surveys determined that these urchins are aggregating by color at times of their reproductive season when they are more likely to spawn. Tests for HWE using field data of urchin phenotypes suggest strong deviations from HWE. Paternal success in broadcast spawners is largely determined by the proximity of males to spawning females and the compatibility between them at the time they release their gametes. Selection is predicted to favor traits and behaviors that increase the likelihood of spawning near a more compatible neighbor.

Most predators need to sense prey to capture them, and prey must detect predators to enact a flee response. Within a predator-prey system, prey predation and trait changes in prey induced by predators – e.g., heightened evasion behaviors or strengthened protective structures - can have positive indirect effects on the basal resource consumed by prey. Conditions of ‘sensory stress,’ where environmental factors interfere with the ability of predators and prey to sense each other, can disrupt such interactions. Especially difficult to predict are impacts of sensory stress on the basal resource since outcomes are influenced by both predation rates and prey trait changes. Predation rates may increase with sensory stress if prey cease to respond to predators, but the positive indirect effects from increased predation may be counteracted by the lack of trait changes in prey. Here, we explore these complexities using a tri-trophic population model. It reveals the importance of two parameters: the relative sensitivity of the predator and prey to sensory stress and the degree to which prey trait changes involve foraging. The former dictates whether predation or trait changes dominate the system. The second determines whether basal resources increase or decrease under sensory stress. Our findings highlight the need to consider not only how both predator and prey react to sensory stress, but also the nature of the trait changes induced in prey when evaluating trophic connections in a community.",Organismal/Population Biology,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

However, the offspring size-performance relationship is highly context-dependent and environments that alter the size-dependent fitness of offspring can pose important consequences for the evolution of offspring size. Temperature gradients produce clear patterns in offspring size – among and within species, and even within a single individual, mothers produce larger offspring in cooler environments.

We found that PDO has a strong influence on low zone intertidal communities but other cycles do not.  Using SIMPER, we also found that coralline turf cover drives the most change between years.

In this study, we compared fish assemblages at breakwaters and natural reef sites in three different regions along 500+ kilometers of the East Australian coast, spanning a subtropical-temperate transition zone. We found that breakwater assemblages tended to have strikingly different multivariate assemblages. Assemblages on breakwaters also varied less over latitudinal gradients than assemblages on natural reefs. However, univariate analyses (total abundance, biomass, diversity and species richness) indicated that breakwater assemblages are only sometimes different.  At the mixed coral, rock and kelp reefs of sub-tropical regions assemblages showed similarities (no metrics significantly different) whereas at temperate rock and kelp reefs all but one reef type x metric contrast was significantly different.

Shifts in the patterns of exudation were characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy which analyzes the composition of the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM). Although bulk measures of fDOM were similar between substrates and nutrient levels, coral derived fDOM exudates were compositionally distinct from other substrates and from ambient pools, enriched in proteinaceous compounds. Moreover nutrient addition increased exudation of coral-derived fDOM in specific fluorescent regions that may indicate differential production of dissolved organic matter by coral in shifting inorganic nutrient regimes.

Additionally, *B. nubilus* likely experience hypoxia during low-tide emersion, and lack an oxygen binding pigment. We are interested in the unique metabolic and structural adaptations of giant *B. nubilus* muscle fibers that allow them to maintain function in spite of a low internal oxygen environment.

We also revealed a significant increase in pCO~2~ by 6h in the anoxic group, and by 9h in both anoxia and emersion. Thus, tidal emersion only mildly decreases hemolymph pO~2~ and increases pCO~2~ compared to the more extreme stress of submerged anoxia.

We initiated studies to address this gap in our understanding of OA on marine communities by investigating the effects of reduced seawater pH on the early life history of the sponge, *Halichondria panicea*. We collected reproductive sponges from an intertidal site on the Oregon Coast and induced larval release in the lab.

We tracked larval settlement and growth over a six day period. We found that reduced seawater pH had no effect on larval mortality, but was associated with increases in settlement rate and reductions in post-settlement growth.

As non-extractive activities such as SCUBA diving increase in popularity, recreational users are concentrating inside marine reserves.  Current design and management of marine protected areas often assumes negligible effects of SCUBA diving despite a lack of studies quantifying these effects.  We measured the reactions of *Sparisoma viride*, an abundant herbivore, to recreational diver presence and approaches across a gradient of chronic intensity in diver activity surrounding Little Cayman Island, where spear fishing is prohibited and SCUBA diving tourism is popular.  We found significantly reduced flight initiation and alert distances at sites with the highest current and historical levels of SCUBA diving activity, as compared to sites with no tourist diving activity.  While these results support the conclusion that *S. viride* has habituated to diver presence with respect to anti-predator behavior, we also found a uniform suppression of bite rates at all sites when a diver remained inside the alert distance of a focal fish.  This suppressed grazing suggests that even fish with increased tolerance towards divers may still be incurring fitness costs in their presence.

Biophysical models provide compelling and detailed spatial hypotheses of dispersal across seascapes, and inferences from such models are increasingly being used to support spatial planning for conservation and fisheries. How well biophysical models provide accurate spatial summaries of dispersal history, however, is unresolved. At large geographic scales, intraspecific spatial genetic structure provides an observable, albeit murky, outcome of past generations of dispersal, but is limited both by the high variance of evolutionary genetic processes and constrained sampling efforts. Here, we focus on a foundational coral from the Great Barrier Reef, *Acropora tenuis*; we draw upon a customized biophysical dispersal model and a spatially extensive microsatellite data set (43 populations, 1928 distinct multilocus genotypes) to test for correlations between independent estimators of dispersal and diversity derived from biophysical models, reef configuration, and genetics.",,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Over this time period, an 80% reduction in habitat area due to changes in sediment deposition coincided with the disappearance of 2 of 6 large predatory gastropod species and a decline in the relative abundance of specialist relative to generalist gastropods. To investigate the effects of these compositional changes, we experimentally examined trophic interactions among community members in mimicked current and historical food webs. We found that the top predator (horse conch) had the greatest predatory effect on the 2 species that had disappeared from the community (lace murex and true tulip) and that lace murex had the greatest predatory effect on basal resources (bivalves). Therefore, the community not only experienced a reduction in the number of interaction pathways due to species loss, but also loss of the strongest top-down effects among trophic levels. Given that strong interactions are often unstable, this result may reflect loss of the least stable interactions in response to habitat loss.

While the causes are still debated, the loss of herbivores and subsequent increase in algae has contributed to the decline. In recent years, there have been increasing calls for protection of key herbivores, especially parrotfishes, since increasing parrotfish abundance should reduce algal cover and algal competition with corals and/or provide additional free space for coral settlement. While protection of herbivores in general should increase herbivory, different species have different feeding and habitat preferences, and therefore have differing impacts on benthic communities. Therefore, the grazing impact of parrotfish assemblages may vary dramatically with changes in assemblage structure. We use data on species-level grazing preferences of parrotfishes in the Florida Keys and USVI combined with long-term monitoring data on parrotfish abundance to predict overall assemblage-level grazing impacts. Our results show that overall grazing impacts vary dramatically geographically and among habitat types, suggesting that different parrotfish assemblages have very different impacts on benthic algae, and therefore also vary in the strength of indirect positive effects on corals.

Predator cues can change prey behavior, however, introduced predators may not be recognized by native prey. Response to cues may be influenced by climate driven changes in air or water temperature affecting consumer metabolism and foraging rates. To examine these factors, we measured how the foraging rate of an intertidal snail (*Acanthinucella spirata*) on mussels (*Arcuatula senhousia*) changes in the presence of native crabs (*Romaleon antennarium*) or non-native crabs (*Carcinus maenas*) in Tomales Bay, CA. We also examined how snail growth and morphology changed in the presence of the two crabs.
Native crabs suppressed rates of snail tissue and shell growth, while non-native crabs only suppressed shell growth. We found that snails grew tissue and shell faster in warmer waters, independent of predator presence. Both native and non-native crabs influenced snail length. The evidence indicates that snails can react to both to native and non-native crabs, and may be able to respond to these species accordingly. Water temperature had a linear effect on shell growth, but a threshold effect on tissue growth, with no interaction between temperature and crab presence.

Phytoplankton subsidies are linked to variations in surfzone hydrodynamics and this variation may alter reproductive output of organisms. During Spring/Summer 2016, I enumerated phytoplankton weekly at 10 shores with varying surf zone widths within a 7-km region near Charleston, Oregon. I also compared reproductive output of barnacle, *Balanus glandula*, and mussel, *Mytilus californianus*, populations to surfzone hydrodynamics. Wider, more dissipative surf zones had, on average, >8x the concentration of coastal phytoplankton than where surf zones were narrow, more reflective. Individuals at dissipative shores also had significantly higher reproductive output than those at more reflective shores. On average, mean *B. glandula* larval production/100 cm^2^ was 4x higher at more dissipative shores; percent cover of *B. glandula* was also 4x higher at more dissipative shores.

It is unclear though if any “carry-over” effects will occur when embryos are fertilized in cold, low pH seawater then allowed to develop under “normal” conditions with higher pH and temperature.  We tested whether such a carry-over effect would occur for red abalone larvae using a laboratory experiment.  Gravid red abalone were induced to spawn, and gametes were collected.

However, determining which of these two traits is more important for invasion success will provide insight into how invasive species expand their range, as well as how that species may affect the rest of the community. 
We compared marine invertebrate fouling communities in northern and southern California to determine how competitive interactions with recruitment by an invasive species (*Watersipora subtorquata*) affect community structure across space and time. We found that both the number of competitive interactions and recruitment by *W. subtorquata* differ significantly between regions and across months. This suggests that these two mechanisms of success vary with season, but more interestingly, their relative importance depends on region. Overall, competitive interactions tend to be more important in southern California in October, but recruitment becomes more important in May and June.

Fur seal and sea lion pelts have a similar thermal conductivity in air, whereas phocid seal pelts have a higher conductivity and therefore reduced function in air. However, the thermal function of the pelt in water has never been quantitatively compared among groups. This study examined the effects of submergence on the thermal function of pinniped pelts by measuring thermal conductivity and thermal resistance of fur seal, sea lion, and phocid pelts in water. Under conditions of submergence, fur seal pelts (N=17) had the lowest thermal conductivity; sea lion (N=20) and phocid (N=9) pelts had significantly higher thermal conductivities. Taking fur thickness into account, fur seal pelts had the highest thermal resistance in water, whereas sea lion and phocid seal pelts had lower and nearly equal thermal resistance values. Although fur seal and sea lion pelts function similarly in air, the ability of the fur seal pelt to trap air while submerged makes it a superior insulator in water. In contrast, sea lions and phocids must depend on their blubber for insulation when submerged.

Pigment concentrations and photosynthetic rates were higher with nutrient addition at 16 days, but the difference disappeared or was reduced at 25 days.

We drew water from two closed seawater systems maintained at pH 8.2, one of which contained a co-occurring predator, *Cancer productus*.

Second, duration of hermit-crab withdrawal after a light tap was significantly reduced when tested in the presence of predator odor; this reduction was abolished by slightly acidic water. These experiments leave open the possibility that slight acidity makes hermit crabs sick, thereby reducing behavioral vigor. Our third assay avoided that ambiguity by showing that a 70% reduction in feeding rate of *P. samuelis* in the presence of predator odor was completely eliminated by slightly acidic water, increasing the hermit crab feeding rate to predator-free levels.

These differences likely reflect rapid evolutionary shifts during the last 100 years. We also detected a latitudinal decline in heat tolerance along eastern North American shores that re-capitulated a parallel decline in native Japan. This novel cline indicates that the spread of *G. vermiculophylla* along an introduced shoreline was sometimes accompanied by local adaptation after establishment.

During 15 -20hr observations exposed sea urchins initially fled from injured conspecifics, then avoided areas containing conspecific alarm cues throughout the night while cryptic sea urchins were more likely to remain in crevices for the entirety of the observation when conspecific alarm cues were present. Conspecific alarm cues did not lead to longer term avoidance (>1 week) of an area by exposed sea urchins.

In this study, we used an allometric approach to quantify interspecific biomass partitioning patterns in kelps and assess whether embryophyte-based predictions of biomass scaling can be applied to marine macrophytes that lack root-to-leaf hydraulic transport. Photosynthetic area and dry mass were found to scale to approximately the ¾ power and kelp biomass allocation patterns were shown to match closely to empirical measures of allometric scaling among woody plants.

The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the interconversion between these two carbon species. Not all algal species are equipped with CA and thus rely on CO^2^ as their only source of carbon, the concentration of which is much lower than HCO~3~^-^. To investigate the presence/absence of CA and the partitioning of carbon species in a macroalgal community, 39 subtidal species (27 red, 10 brown, 2 green) from British Columbia were assayed for their external and total activity of CA. In addition, their capacity to uptake HCO~3~^-^ vs CO^2^ was examined by comparing the rate of photosynthetic O^2^-evolution with the photosynthetic rate which could be supported solely by CO^2^ arising from the uncatalyzed dehydration of HCO~3~^-^. The final data addressing the activity of CA are currently being collected, but preliminary results show that CA was detected in most species tested, notably excluding *Codium setchellii*. It is also clear that the presence/absence of CA cannot be determined strictly by taxonomy or ecology (e.g. epiphytism). Similarly, the mean rate of photosynthetic O^2^-evolution varied within taxonomic groups; for example, the rates for multiple species within genera (e.g. *Hymenena*, *Saccharina*) differed significantly.

Diets may vary naturally among populations, but inferences about diets may depend on the methods used to measure them. We used two complementary methods, stomach content and stable isotope analysis, to quantify the diet of four separate populations of the black surfperch *Embiotoca jacksoni*. Black surfperch forage in algae for small invertebrates, and can be territorial about foraging grounds. Stomach content analysis provides data on a short temporal scale – we can directly observe what a fish most recently consumed. However, this method may not detect prey items that are quickly digested. Stable isotope signatures provide diet data at longer temporal scales. Because “you are what you eat,” rare isotopes from prey are incorporated into a predator’s tissues, allowing us to make inferences about an individual’s long-term diet. In this study, both measures indicated significant, among-population variation in diets. Stomach content and isotope data were significantly, but weakly correlated. This may be because isotope analysis is detecting prey not observed in the stomach or that identical prey species from different populations differ with respect to isotope signatures, or a certain degree of both.

The fear large carnivores inspire in mesopredators may be a crucial component of their role in mitigating mesopredator impacts, causing cascading effects across food webs, but such fear effects remain controversial due to a lack of experimental tests. In this talk, I will describe work conducted in a coastal system where mesopredator raccoons have been released from top-down control following the extirpation of large carnivores. In the absence of large carnivores, raccoons exhibit a lack of fear (i.e., indifference to large carnivore cues), which may contribute to their severe impacts on intertidal prey. Experimentally restoring the fear of large carnivores using month-long playbacks of large carnivore vocalizations largely reversed raccoon impacts, reducing raccoon foraging to the benefit of their prey, which led to further cascading effects throughout the intertidal community. These results indicate that the loss of fear accompanying large carnivore extirpation is a major driver of the impacts of mesopredator release. Where large carnivores are present in coastal habitats, intertidal prey abundance may be expected to be higher. However, new research suggests that substantial dietary overlap between large carnivores and mesopredators could result in redundancy in their impacts on intertidal prey. Taken together, the work presented here will show that interactions among terrestrial carnivores play an important role in shaping coastal food webs.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

Kelp frames were deployed for five months, during which we concurrently measured light, temperature, nutrients, water motion and kelp growth (as changes in elongation, blade area, pigmentation and biomass). Effects of nutrients and temperature on kelp growth were statistically indistinguishable among sites, and the effect of light was only detectable at deeper depths.  In contrast, all measures of kelp growth were greatest at the most wave-exposed site and lowest at the most protected site.

Ecologists have spent years devising novel ways to quantify and compare larval delivery across both temporal and spatial scales. Some of these methods include pumps, nets, settlement plates, and a variety of traps. The majority of these methods only sample over a narrow temporal scale while others employ mechanisms prone to wear and clogging in the detritus-filled littoral waters. In this experiment, we tested a simple plankton trap design, built from widely available materials, which combines a novel mechanism for one-way fluid flow and a durable housing. This created an intertidal zooplankton trap capable of sampling for extended periods of time in intense wave-swept shores. This new trap design is an improvement on similar traps in its ability to integrate sampling during wave swash and after being submerged. The one-way valve design exhibits durability and allows the trap to sample even large pieces of detritus without clogging. Additionally, sample retrieval can be accomplished in less than a minute and worn parts can be changed in situ, making trap maintenance simple.  Experimental results show this trap to be as efficient at sampling zooplankton as is a current design, the RIPTII by Castilla and Varas. However, the RIPTII was designed to stop collecting during high water, while our trap continues to sample.

We use multi-species models to evaluate community dynamics, and find evidence for stable equilibria at some control sites but alternative community states at others (one kelp dominated, one urchin dominated).

At the sea otter impact sites, we find evidence for a massive perturbation in the early 2000s that seems to represent the combined influence of disease and increasing sea otter predation on red and purple urchins: the communities at those sites then transition to a new state not previously seen, characterized by abundant understory kelps and fleshy red algae.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

The canopy kelp, *Nereocystis luetkeana*, occurs infrequently downstream of glacial melt, while the understory kelp, *Saccharina latissima*, is common around thick layers of sediment. The microscopic stage (gametophyte) of these kelps is critical for maintaining populations but may be sensitive to sediment. Our goal was to determine whether *N. luetkeana* and *S. latissima* gametophytes compete, and whether their interaction is altered by sediments. We examined the effect of sediment on growth and survival over six days. In single species treatments, there was no effect of sediment on growth or survival of either species.

Along the Pacific coast the invasive *M. galloprovincialis* can withstand elevated heat exposure, but it is vulnerable to hyposalinity while the native *M. trossulus* is more tolerant to hyposaline conditions but vulnerable to heat stress. Additionally, aerial emersion during low tide exposes mussels to heat stress and physiological hypoxia. Recent findings suggest that sirtuins, a group of NAD^+^ dependent deacetylases, influence the environmental stressor tolerances in these two mussel species. Therefore, our work uses proteomics to understand the role of sirtuins in regulating the cellular stress response (CSR) in Mytilid mussels exposed to environmental stressors (heat, hypoxia, aerial heat, and hyposalinity). By chemically inhibiting sirtuin deacetylase activity we have found a clear inhibition of CSR proteins (antioxidants, molecular chaperones) key to maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress, proteins related to energy metabolism (isocitrate dehydrogenase), and cell signaling (ERK2). Moreover, our studies highlight the stark difference in stress tolerance between the two mussel congeners possibly due to sirtuin regulation.

As the pups learn to swim and feed on their own during the 8-week period before they depart for sea, they rely solely on the energy reserves they gained during nursing for their caloric demands and water supply. The prolonged absence of food during post-weaning is the first of many fasts for which the seals have evolved adaptations. The purpose of this study was to understand the fasting-induced adaptive responses of pups during this critical transition from a terrestrial to aquatic lifestyle. To do so, we collected skeletal muscle and both inner and outer adipose tissues from pre- and post- weaning pups (n = 20). We analyzed the samples with mass-spectrometry-based proteomics using 2D gel electrophoresis. In the muscle and outer adipose tissue, we found significant decreases in glycolytic proteins, possibly indicating a shift from a carbohydrate to a lipid-based metabolism. In all three tissues, we found increases in cytoskeletal proteins and oxygen-binding proteins that aid in the development of diving ability in post-weaning pups. We also found significant changes in the abundance of oxidative stress proteins in all three tissues, highlighting how the unique stressors of each weaning phase effect the pup’s physiology differently.

The Aleutian Archipelago contains established oceanographic regions that vary in productivity and it is not well understood how these regions structure patterns of productivity in benthic macroinvertebrates. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that size structure and abundance of urchins correlate with known oceanographic breaks, with alternative hypotheses that demography varies at smaller scales (i.e., site or island) or does not vary across the Aleutians. We tested these hypotheses using sea urchin abundance and size structure data collected  over the last 30 years from >250 sites, across 20 islands. Evaluation of patterns showed clear differences in abundance and size structure at both island, driven by localized events that may include disease outbreaks, and regional scales, corresponding to oceanographic breaks.

Here, we utilized the recent outbreak of wasting disease along the California coast as a unique natural experiment to evaluate the extent of sea star-*Tegula* interactions in kelp forests off Monterey, Big Sur, and San Luis Obispo. In each study area, we surveyed one reef where local disease impacts were severe, removing all predatory sea stars (SS-), and one nearby control reef where some predators remained present (SS+). Although predator densities at SS+ sites were extremely low (0.05-0.20/m^2^), distinct differences in *Tegula* grazing behavior were  observed. Approximately 90% of snails at SS+ sites were found grazing on giant kelp (low nutritional content, vertical refuge), while 47-52% of snails at SS- sites were observed on benthic red algae (highly nutritious, vulnerable to predators). *Tegula* collected from SS- sites also had significantly larger gonads (% body weight) and a larger proportion of ripe gonads compared to SS+ locations. These results suggest that predatory sea stars may play a key role in regulating *Tegula* grazing activity, as well as determining their local population dynamics.

This is a reasonable assumption in populations with a 50:50 sex ratio. However, there are scenarios in which population sex ratios may become highly skewed. These include the size-selective harvest of sex-changing fishes (i.e., the fishery may effectively target only the males), or populations exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals that cause sex reversal. When males become scarce, the shape of the *mating function* – the relationship between sex ratio and fertilized egg production – becomes highly important. Past modeling efforts have simply used a generic shape for this relationship that assumes that a single male can fertilize many females. We show that modeling results for sex-changing fish in marine protected areas and for fish exposed to endocrine disruptors are actually highly sensitive to the shape of the mating function. We also conducted laboratory spawning experiments to quantify the mating function for inland silversides, *Menidia beryllina*, and found that it was nearly linear, implying strong male limitation.

We assessed the capacity of large MPAs to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near-Threatened species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology.  We found that the 54,000 km^2^ U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for the entire study.  Additionally, our analysis of  > 0.5 million satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can benefit mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also highlight limitations of large MPAs as some of these reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries captured 2 % of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for reef sharks.",Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

SSTs vary coherently with available instrument records of North Pacific cyclone variance over the past century yet vacillated in and out of coherence with multi-centennial drought reconstructions as a response to SST-driven alterations of storm tracks reaching North America. These results indicate that an influence of decadal-scale variability on the North Pacific storm tracks only became apparent during the mid-20^th^ century.

But despite the overwhelming ubiquity of parasites, relatively few studies have assessed the response of parasitic species to human impacts like biodiversity loss. Substantial disagreement exists as to whether parasite abundance will increase or decrease in response to disturbance, or whether such generalizations are even possible. To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the abundance of fish parasites of seven coral reef fishes collected from three fished and three unfished atolls of the Northern Line Islands archipelago in the central equatorial Pacific. We found that fishing substantially depressed jackknife estimates of parasite species richness. We also found that the response of parasite abundance varied substantially among parasite taxa. Directly transmitted parasites were significantly more abundant on fished than on unfished atolls, while trophically transmitted parasites were significantly more abundant on unfished than fished atolls. This might arise because increasing life cycle complexity increases the probability that some obligately required host will be negatively affected by fishing, and because parasites with a single parasitic life stage can take advantage of fishing-driven, compensatory increases in abundance of some hosts within the host range. Together, these results suggest that fishing disturbance erodes parasite richness, but has variable impacts on parasite abundance.",N/A,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk"

We know from modeling studies that age-structured populations should be more sensitive to environmental signals at low frequencies and generational frequencies, and that, furthermore, these peaks in sensitivity and the overall variability in abundance should increase with decreasing survival, such as through fishing.  Testing the importance of these effects in nature requires empirical examination of existing population time series.  However, these sensitivities may have been altered in unknown ways by hatchery supplementation.  We modeled how annual additions of hatchery fish to an exploited salmon population would change the expected responses of Chinook salmon, a species that is heavily supplemented. While addition of a constant number of hatchery fish raised equilibrium recruitment numbers as expected, it only slightly diminished variability in spawner abundance.  However, supplementation did substantially alter the time scales of variability, increasing the sensitivity to low frequency environmental variability, and if high enough, reducing the peak in sensitivity to generational frequencies associated with exploitation.

The proposed research builds upon a model already parameterized to quantify the effects of temperature and food availability on mussels by examining how predation risk - the “fear of being eaten” - may alter thermal sensitivity under more realistic field conditions where predators are present. By measuring performance metrics (assimilation, respiration, etc.) under different levels of temperature and predation risk, resulting model simulations and outputs from empirical observations will enhance understanding of how organism’s perform in a dynamic environment. This approach will be coupled with measurements of cellular stress responses associated with a few key metabolic processes that are likely to be induced by variation in temperature and predation risk and influence prey energetic budgets.
