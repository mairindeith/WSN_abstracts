Recovery may be particularly difficult if stock abundance drops below critical thresholds for successful breeding.  Abalone species, for example, may experience mass mortality over a large spatial scale from upwelling of hypoxic water and have low fertilization success at densities below 0.2 adults per m^2.  By maintaining higher pre-collapse densities, marine protected areas (MPAs) can disperse larvae into fished regions post-collapse and rescue populations below the Allee threshold.  Using a spatially-explicit continuous-size model with stochastic dispersal, we investigated whether the establishment of a system of MPAs speeds post-catastrophe recovery of abundance and catch as compared to non-spatial management.  We found that MPA networks eliminated the risk of extinction following a moderate catastrophe while fisheries under traditional MSY management often continued to decline.  Although MPAs did not speed recovery or increase overall catch compared to traditional management in non-collapse scenarios, the use of spatial management allowed the fishery to withstand higher severity, more frequent catastrophes.  Similar resilience could be achieved via post-catastrophe harvest delays at the expense of lower or no catch for several decades.  We suggest that, for broadcast spawners experiencing Allee effects, the use of MPAs provides a buffer against mass mortality events while providing a lower but stable post-catastrophe catch.",Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Fisheries Ecology,,,No

However, the extent to which different dimensions of diversity (e.g., the number of genotypes vs. the extent of genetic differentiation among those genotypes) best predicts functioning is unknown and may yield clues into the different mechanisms underlying diversity effects. We explicitly test the relative influence of genotypic richness and genetic relatedness in a factorial field experiment using the seagrass species, *Zostera marina* (eelgrass). Final realized genetic diversity, but not initial planted diversity of eelgrass genotypes influenced final biomass, leaf growth rate, and invertebrate grazer richness and abundance. Eelgrass biomass in a plot increased with the genotypic richness and decreased with the relatedness of genotypes remaining in that plot. In contrast, relatedness was positively correlated with leaf growth rate and invertebrate grazer richness and abundance. Trait diversity of assemblages increased with genotypic richness, likely providing a mechanism underlying the effects of genotypic richness. Relatedness effects were more complicated, leading to higher aboveground leaf growth rates but lower belowground biomass, potentially as a result of shifting resource allocation when competing with close kin vs. unrelated individuals. We show that multiple dimensions of biodiversity contribute independently to eelgrass biomass accumulation and community structuring through a number of mechanisms.",Community Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Community metrics are often monitored to determine whether the community is shifting temporally and spatially.  As sediment contamination levels continue to decrease in the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, it is expected that the benthic infauna community will shift to less pollutant-tolerant organisms.  Seldom studied is how shifts in benthic organisms are expected to affect fish movement and habitat selection as fish should distribute themselves to match the distribution of their prey.  In this study, the benthic community was compared within regions and between years (1976, 2006, 2008, and 2013) in the LA-LB harbors and compared to white croaker habitat selection.  The benthic community composition differed significantly with year and harbor region. While the decline in abundance of pollutant-tolerant polychaetes (historical prey items of white croaker), suggests white croaker diet has shifted over time with the changing benthic community.

The distribution of *Gorgonia ventalina*, *Eunicea flexuosa*, *Pseudoplexaura* spp., and *Antillogorgia* spp. was scored by microhabitat, their nearest neighboring octocorals were scored to evaluate community implications of microhabitat choice, and for *G. ventalina*, the implications of microhabitat choice were evaluated through colony size and shape. Most (61%) *G. ventalina* were attached to vertical surfaces, and 50% of *Antillogorgia* spp. to horizontal surfaces. *G. ventalina* were 25 ± 4 cm from other octocorals on horizontal surfaces, but on vertical/inclined surfaces their nearest neighbors were 11 ± 2 cm away. For *G. ventalina*, most (63%) nearest neighbors in vertical microhabitats were *E. flexuosa* that were separated by only 5 ± 1 cm. There was no difference in *G. ventalina* size or shape among microhabitats, suggesting that microhabitat does not affect adult success.

Because fucoids in general are thought to have very limited dispersal, loss due to this oil spill made *F. gardneri* a candidate for manipulative restoration; attempts are currently underway in the San Francisco Bay. Prior to restoration experiments, we assessed the genetic structure of *F. gardneri* in the bay to determine suitable donor populations. The initial restoration model was to use fertile fragments of *F. gardneri* in mesh bags as gamete sources to seed recipient patches: recruitment did not ensue. *F. gardneri* juveniles were also settled onto small cobbles in the laboratory which were outplanted by being adhered to intertidal bedrock; all outplanted juveniles died. Most recently, we developed an approach to use adult plants translocated from donor patches within the bay to recipient patches also in the bay.

Infaunal diversity dropped and heretofore unobserved conspicuous dead *Emerita analoga* (sand crabs) were common in the swash zone across several beaches although an independent decline in sandy beach infaunal diversity/abundance across the region over the past year made impact detection problematic.  Laboratory experiments confirmed the toxicity of deposited tar to developing *Emertia* embryos, juveniles, and adults.

Captive breeding success has surged over the past four years; however, production remains limited by poor reproductive condition of broodstock. White abalone tend to reproduce once yearly during the late winter through early spring, and it is likely that one or more environmental cues exist to trigger gametogenesis. We investigated the effects of photoperiod on white abalone growth, reproductive condition, and spawning success. White abalone were held under both natural and accelerated (2x) photoperiod conditions. We assessed and attempted to spawn animals out of season, in late summer 2015, when abalone in the accelerated photoperiod treatment were experiencing early springtime (spawning season) photoperiods. Abalone held in the accelerated photoperiod treatment had higher gonad indices and produced more gametes than those in the natural photoperiod conditions.

Kelp forests from the exposed and protected environments of Todos Santos, San Martin, and San Jeronimo Islands were studied. In each forest north and south sites benthic observations were recorded by SCUBA diving filming three transects of 10 x 1.5 m per site. The videos were analysed, species identified and counted. Overall, the exposed environments registered higher species diversity; however, the community structure of the exposed vs protected environments was not significantly different.

The sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, is a keystone species in the intertidal zone and are currently being affected by Sea Star Wasting Disease (SSWD). Since the spring 2013, sea star populations in the rocky intertidal of northern California have fluctuated due to SSWD. Fluctuating populations of P. ochraceus will result in an inverse effect of their prey populations, which include chiton, limpets and snails.

Every 5 meters along each band transect mobile invertebrate species within a 0.25m2 quadrat were counted.

Reports of coral demise often focus purely on total coral cover with little focus on demography of corals.  Size structure is often used to evaluate status of populations of concern and can indicate degree of impact as well as predict population trajectories.  Many coral monitoring programs collect such data; however, size structure may not be a useful indicator due to fragmentation, space competition and morphological diversity.  In order to evaluate the utility of size structure data for determining status of coral communities, we used data from two different monitoring programs, one in the Caribbean (Belize) where coral cover is low and one in the Indo-Pacific (Micronesia) where many reefs have high coral cover.  We found size structure of corals on low vs. high coral-cover reefs to be remarkably similar, with size structure skewed strongly toward small colonies.  Additionally, there is no clear relationship between coral density, coral diversity and coral size structure.  These results suggest that coral size structure may be a poor indicator of coral reef health, yet some aspects of demography may yield important insights for assessing coral reef health.",,,No,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),Yes

Despite the ubiquity of these transitions, and their profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, we still have a limited understanding of the genetic changes that underlie such developmental shifts. To determine how larval developmental mode is inherited, we hybridized the two sea biscuit species, *Clypeaster rosaceus* and *C. subdepressus*.  These species possess different larval types: *C. rosaceus* larvae do not need to feed to develop, whereas *C. subdepressus* larvae are obligately planktotrophic.  By characterizing development of hybrid offspring in fed and starved conditions, we determined the developmental mode of each interspecific cross. The offspring from each hybrid cross all developed like their maternal species.  However, because echinoid larvae obtain both energy and hormones essential for metamorphosis from their algal food, we also set up an additional starved treatment where we added the thyroid hormone, thyroxine.  Every larval cross was able to metamorphose without food in the presence of thyroxine.  These results provide strong evidence that the evolution of non-feeding larval development is not solely due to changes in egg energy content, but also must involve changes in hormonal regulation and synthesis.",Evolutionary Biology,Reproductive Biology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Gnathia marleyi is a small host-generalist fish parasite found on shallow reefs throughout the Eastern Caribbean. Gnathiids are susceptible to predation by live stony coral but the ecological effects of this predation are unknown. If predation by live coral polyps is a significant limiting factor for gnathiid populations, gnathiid micropredation could have a disproportionately large effect on fish populations where live coral cover has been lost. We surveyed gnathiid density and assessed fish abundance and live coral cover at three reef sites in the Virgin Islands. Daytime fish abundance in each quadrant of each site and live coral cover estimates at each sample point were negatively correlated with gnathiid abundance. We conclude that live coral cover may be a limiting factor in gnathiid density and that increased gnathiid density and decreased fish abundance in low-coral-cover habitat increases the negative effects of micropredation on individual fish in this habitat.",Population Biology and Ecology,Species-Habitat Associations,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

In response to increased carbon dioxide levels in seawater, photosynthesizing plants and algae may not only benefit physiologically, but also biologically alter their local environment in a way that mitigates physiological stress on surrounding species. Thus, this sequestration of extraneous carbon dioxide induces localized ocean change refugia.   Recent evidence has shown beds of seagrasses can provide such localized refugia to low pH conditions.  This project investigated how the potentially vulnerable early life stages of the seagrass species, *Phyllospadix torreyi*, responds to elevated COsub(2) levels, and how seedling development impacts the surrounding seawater chemistry. In this study, we raised seagrass seedlings under ambient, moderate, and high pCOsub(2) treatments for three weeks while tracking growth, germination, and water chemistry. Our findings suggest seedlings developed faster in increased COsub(2) conditions and the seedlings exerted potentially biologically relevant changes on the surrounding seawater chemistry.

This phenomenon has historically been attributed to evolutionary tuning of coral thermal limits to the conditions of their local environment (i.e. local adaptation). A growing body of evidence finds that corals from different micro-habitats within the same reef-system (500m to 5km apart) can differ in bleaching tolerances as much as corals from reefs separated by 100s - 1000s of kilometers. Here, we compare the response of corals to experimental heat stress from three study sites: shallow back-reef pools in American Samoa, a nearshore and offshore patch reef in the Florida Keys, and a back- and fore-reef in Belize. In all three cases, corals from micro-habitats with the highest daily variability in temperature showed the greatest resistance to bleaching compared to conspecifics from neighboring sites with more stable temperatures. Bleaching differences were consistent despite substantial common garden acclimation (30, 36, and 240 days for Belizean, Samoan, and Floridian corals respectively), and similar symbiont types. These results suggest that thermal variability plays an important role in shaping coral bleaching thresholds, and that local adaptation could be as common at within-reef scales as it is thought to be across latitudinal gradients in ocean temperatures.",Physiological Ecology,Evolutionary Biology,,,No

However, little is known about pH levels relative to thallus location. This study examined 1) whether pH varies within *Desmarestia ligulata* thalli and 2) if pH variability reduced herbivory by the common kelp forest herbivore *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*.  We measured thallus pH relative to location; sampling from the base, midrib, apical tip, and branch of *D. ligulata*.  The pH varied significantly relative to the thallus location.  The mean pH at the base was higher (3.x) than was found in the apical tip, branches, and middle of the midrib (2.x, 2.x, 2.x respectively). A series of comparative grazing experiments were preformed to examine if *S. purpuratus* preferentially grazed on a neutral algae or the acidic *D. ligulata* as a timed pulsed choice experiment. Cores of blade tips from *Pterygophora californica* and *D. ligulata* were offered to *S. purpuratus* in replicated aquaria.

We extrapolated habitat associations beyond the sampled areas to broader areas of the coast. The results of this study clearly depicted an ontogenetic shift in Lingcod habitat utilization.

To explore both biotic and abiotic forces contributing to salt marsh loss in such a system, we conducted a long term study that focused on how species interactions of perennial halophytic shrub, *Sarcocornia pacifica* and native grapsid crab species, *Pachygrapsus crassipes*, influences marsh dieback and erosion in west coast estuary, Elkhorn Slough. The results of the 2+ year long press caging experiment showed that *P. crassipes* may be facilitating salt marsh loss through herbivory of S. pacifica (we conducted crab feeding trials that confirmed *P. crassipes'* dietary preference for root material and new shoots) and burrowing (avg. 30.64 burrows/m2) leading to a decrease in above- and below-ground biomass, thus weakening the sediment matrix and indirectly encouraging erosion in an already drowning marsh.

As part of the Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research Project, we have used a novel long-term, large-scale (25 years, 1500 km coastline) dataset of giant kelp canopy biomass to determine the most important environmental drivers. We then fit generalized additive and linear models to determine the nonlinear effect and relative importance of each potential driver. We found that maximum significant wave height, mean nitrate, and the state of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation were the most important predictors, and that the nonlinear effect shapes of these drivers as well as previous kelp occupancy, harvest effort and sea urchin density helped explain spatial differences in relative effect size. These results led to a site-specific model whose modeled hindcast matches up well with observations at many sites and may be able to identify spatiotemporal patterns of unknown drivers or forecast canopy biomass patterns under future climate scenarios.

However, rocky shores are nested within larger, latitudinal environmental gradients that could mediate local-scale processes resulting in geographic variation in local adaptation to different tide heights. We used *Fucus vesiculosus* to test our hypothesis that phenotypic differentiation across tide heights would vary among geographic regions. Reciprocal transplants between the upper and lower edges of *Fucus'* intertidal distribution were conducted at sites spanning ~500-km of the Gulf of Maine (GOM) coastline. Changes in biomass revealed phenotypic differentiation across tide heights (i.e., local adaptation) in the northeast, but not elsewhere in the GOM. However, nitrogen assimilation (changes in tissue nitrogen) did not necessarily respond to transplantation in the same way as growth, suggesting further geographic variation in resource allocation. Greater tidal amplitude increases vertical distance between individuals across the intertidal gradient in the northeastern GOM. Thus, barriers to dispersal in some regions may drive geographic variation in phenotypic differentiation in this species.

Using a field survey, a mesocosm experiment, and two field experiments, we examined growth and thallus toughness, a physical defense against herbivores. Survey results showed a weak but significant negative relationship between fish abundance and thallus toughness, mainly driven by greater thallus toughness observed in sites more likely to be nutrient-rich. A mesocosm experiment confirmed a positive relationship between nutrient supply and thallus toughness, with no significant effect on thallus height. Reduction of natural fish herbivory through caging in ambient nutrient conditions reduced thallus toughness, while caged thalli subjected to simulated herbivory maintained thallus toughness at a cost to growth height. Overall, thallus toughness declined and growth increased in response to the removal of fish herbivory pressure, while thallus toughness alone was enhanced by nutrient enrichment. Our study suggests that the physical defense and growth responses of *T. ornata* to increased nutrients and decreased herbivory may have facilitated this macroalga's expansion.",Community Ecology,Plant/Algal Biology,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

We measured the abundances of fish near the benthos and in the canopy immediately prior to harvest, and then 24 hours, 3 weeks, and 10 weeks post-harvest. Immediately post and 3 weeks after harvest, we found the highest abundances of fish at intermediate harvest intensities (20-60%). At 10 weeks post-harvest, however, the abundance of fish increased linearly with harvest intensity, with the highest recorded abundances of juvenile and adult rockfish at 70-90% canopy removal. We also observed the highest increases in the density of understory kelps at these harvest intensities, suggesting that increased light penetration to the substrate following canopy removal may have enhanced fish habitat near the benthos.",,,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

We spawned oysters from six populations distributed among three estuaries in northern California and raised their offspring through two generations under common laboratory conditions. We then exposed second-generation oysters to one of three cue treatments: control seawater, drills eating barnacles, or drills eating oysters. Oysters from all populations grew smaller shells when exposed to drill cues, and grew thicker shells when those drills were eating oysters. Oysters exposed to drills eating other oysters were subsequently less likely to be preyed upon. Oysters from the estuary with the highest drill pressure grew the smallest shells. Our results demonstrate that populations have evolved differences in the strength of their response to drilling predators.

Based on our experience in modeling, monitoring and decision-making for MPA implementation, we propose several best practices. Having a clear expectation for the effects of MPAs on marine communities follows naturally from the concept of adaptive management.  Existing meta-analyses demonstrate that the metrics defining MPA success should be clearly linked to population dynamics or ecosystem health. These performance expectations should account for life history differences among species, the pre-MPA state of the ecosystem (e.g., what the harvest rate was), and the type of community being protected.

With undergraduate classes collecting data, we examined the complex changes to ecosystem function associated with creation and loss of the sandbar, to establish causal links between biological and physical drivers of ecological function- invertebrate production and habitat quantity and quality- in seasonal estuaries. An interdisciplinary approach was used to understand physical and ecological processes associated with bar state in California seasonal estuaries, including: How do bar state, water movement, nutrients, water quality, and primary production directly and indirectly change ecosystem function- habitats and invertebrate production? Are these ecosystems resilient? Conceptual models of ecological process and function were built through synthesis and case studies, and used to identify major drivers of key ecosystem processes  habitat quality and quantity and invertebrate production. Drivers included: mouth state, water quality, and nutrients. The results can predict how key processes will respond to changes such as management actions or climate change. The results are considered in the context of resilience, to evaluate resilience mechanisms and resilience as a management goal.

While the production of MeJA and ethylene has been observed in multiple algal taxa, its role in airborne signaling among intertidal algae, which essentially become terrestrial at low tide, has not been explored. Ulva lactuca were exposed to either airborne methyl jasmonate(0 - 3.35 µM) or ethylene (0 - 2160 µM) for 4 hours, then grown outdoors in a seawater system under 30 or 50% shade cloth. Growth, DMSP (a precursor to defenses and antioxidants), and photosynthetic efficiency were measured over 10 days. High MeJA exposures caused an immediate 20% loss of DMSP (p=.032) and an increase in DMSP over the next several days. Ethylene exposure caused a 59% increase in DMSP (p<.01) after 4 days. Growth and photosynthetic efficiency were reduced after exposure to both hormones, although the differences were not significant. Our results suggest that MeJA stimulates rapid changes in DMSP, which is possibly an immediate stress response, while ethylene regulates its production over longer time scales.

Here, I apply this perspective to rocky shore ecosystems, exploring the causes and consequences of variation in internal nutrient ratios across two trophic levels. Specifically, I measured the internal concentrations of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in mussels (*Mytilus* spp.) and particulate organic matter (POM) to evaluate the effects of stoichiometric mismatch -- the difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) between a consumer and its resources -- on mussel growth at sites on the coasts of Oregon, USA, and the South Island of New Zealand. As POM quality declined, C:N of the POM increased, but C:N of mussels declined. This resulted in a greater mismatch in C:N between mussels and their food source. Mussel growth at a site was positively associated with phytoplankton availability (Chl a), but negatively associated with stoichiometric mismatch. Thus, as the elemental ratios of consumers became more different from those of their resources, growth declined, likely due to the energetic cost associated with processing lower quality food.

Caribbean octocoral forests are therefore expected to change the seascape and play a more prominent role in the next future. To evaluate the implications of this change, we focused on the effect of the octocoral canopy on the current speed and turbulence which can affect the nutrient exchange in the canopy and the feeding capacity of colonies. We measured current speeds around octocoral forests in St. John, US Virgin Islands, to evaluate the extent to which they are modified by canopies.

Limpets modify their behavior in the presence of fish by decreasing grazing and movement. Changes in limpet behavior directly impact the breaking strength of fronds, which has implications for other kelp-associated species. The relative importance of these effects were assessed through simulating predation without the presence of fish by culling limpets at an ecologically realistic rate. Non-consumptive effects constituted 81% of the total predator effect relative to direct consumption.

We examined the effects of association with turf algae, *Chloronotus funebralis* snails, and *Mytilus californianus* mussels on both parasitization and reproduction. To quantify the effects of each association, barnacles were collected at the same tidal height and dissected for  *H. balani*, reproduction, and size. Similarly sized barnacles associated with algae were significantly more infected than were barnacles not associated with algae. Additionally, we found similarly sized barnacles associated with mussels were significantly less infected and significantly more reproductive. Finally, we found barnacles associated with snails were significantly smaller, significantly less infected, and significantly more reproductive than were barnacles not associated with snails.

In our model, the dispersal of larvae is driven primarily by turbulent eddies that collect larvae into coherent ""packets"". The larvae in a packet succeed or fail as a group, which generates large variance in reproductive success of each individual parent. We ask when the stochasticity in packet success favors changes in offspring size, spreading offspring releases over time, or both, to decrease variance in fitness at the expense of producing more offspring in order to increase long-term fitness (i.e., to bet-hedge). Our theory predicts that stochasticity in packet success selects for spreading reproductive effort over time and for offspring sizes that are different from the size that produces the most offspring. Even when there is no bet-hedging in offspring size, a strategy producing a non-optimal size can still prevail against one producing the optimal size if it is correlated with a longer spawning duration.",Reproductive Biology,Dispersal and Recruitment,,,Yes

We quantified how changes in the density, size and behaviour of red urchins (*Mesocentrotus franciscanus*) influence grazing rates on kelp through a subtidal grazing survey and experiment at sites on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. Grazing rates were density dependent, such that kelp loss rates saturated at high densities of urchins. Behaviour was also important, as grazing rates were low when urchins were ""hiding/cryptic"". In our experiment, urchins were exposed to a predator-cue treatment (freshly eviscerated urchin tests), which resulted in decreased grazing compared to controls. In plots with high urchin biomass, this behavioural alarm response resulted in up to 30% less kelp being consumed, whereas treatment plots with lower urchin biomass resulted in 10-20% less kelp being consumed.

These communities can change drastically following the loss of their foundation species. How strong these shifts might be is unclear, as some competitively subordinate species can compensate for foundation species loss. In kelp forest ecosystems, this issue has become increasingly important for areas experiencing kelp loss due to human influences. Here, we examine the consequences of kelp loss for fish populations and communities in a meta-analysis of experimental kelp removals and comparative habitat surveys. We find that kelp loss had no net effect on total adult fish abundance; in contrast, total juvenile abundance was higher in kelp habitats. Further, adult abundances were higher in beds dominated by larger kelps with a multi-stipe morphology (e.g., *Macrocystis* versus *Ecklonia*). We find no effect of kelps on fish species richness in experiments or surveys. However, kelp removals do shift fish community structure. Removals reduce the abundances of fish either at high trophic levels or small in size. Our results show the consequences of foundation species loss may not always be changes in community abundance or diversity, but rather shifts in community composition that could have further consequences for ecosystem function.",Community Ecology,Species-Habitat Associations,,,Yes

Plasticity in drought-resistant traits in plants is well documented, and mutualistic bacteria can increase the fitness of plants in the face of stress. Genotypic variation in rhizobia association may affect the invasion success of some legumes, particularly during a disturbance. Here we address: 1) Is there genotypic variability in the plasticity of drought-resistant traits in plants? 2) Do rhizobia affect genotype responses to drought?, and 3) Do rhizobia affect plant plasticity in response to drought? We used 40 genotypes of Medicago polymorpha to manipulate water levels and rhizobia. We measured root to shoot ratio, root nodule density, and plant biomass (fitness proxy). The plants responses to drought depended on both rhizobia and genotype. We also found varying levels of plasticity among genotypes, and the expression of plasticity in response to drought was dependent on rhizobia treatment. Mutualistic rhizobia may play a role beyond resource mutualism, but it is dependent upon plant genotype. Moreover, the variation in genotypes that we observed in this species that has successfully invaded many parts of the world suggests that genetically determined traits might play a role in invasion success.",,,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

These are habitats for rockfish (genus *Sebastes*), an important ecological and commercial fisheries group whose young-of-year (YOY) recruit to these ecosystems during early development. Thus, we examined the physiological response of YOY rockfishes (*S. mystinus*, *S. paucispinis*, *S. goodei*, *S. serranoides*, and *S. flavidus*) to low dissolved oxygen (DO) to test for differences in hypoxia sensitivities among species.  We used an intermittent-flow respirometry system to measure whole-animal oxygen consumption rates and a video camera to record ventilation rates, while animals were exposed to hypoxic conditions similar to those experienced in nature.  Our results showed that as DO declined to levels ? 4 mg Osub(2)/ L, all species increased their ventilation rate while concurrently transitioning to a lower standard metabolic rate.  Furthermore, we found that these species displayed behavioral and physiological thresholds within the range of [DO] experienced under natural upwelling conditions. Our findings suggest that juvenile rockfish are living near their physiological tolerance limits during hypoxic events and may be vulnerable to future exacerbations in low DO predicted to occur with climate change.",,,No,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Comparatively, feeding was spread more evenly throughout a fish's territory in areas where algal growth rates were slower.  Photo plots were used to track the succession of bite scars through time and demonstrated that the spatial patterning of algae removal and the availability of bare space for coral recruitment differs at these sites.

Ocean currents are important drivers of environmental variation and can influence benthic community dynamics in nearshore systems.  Due to spatial and temporal changes in oceanographic currents, the nearshore systems of the Galápagos experience large variation in ocean temperature (11  31°C).  We conducted surveys quantifying shallow subtidal benthic community patterns across spatial (sites) and temporal (seasons and years) temperature gradients in the Gal?pagos Archipelago.  We examined the relative importance of large-scale processes (temperature) and local-scale consumer assemblages on benthic community structure.  Foliose macroalgae (mainly Ulva spp.) and filamentous (or turf) algae dominate the shallow subtidal benthic communities across the Islands.  Temperature, herbivore biomass and herbivore density were negatively correlated with macroalgal biomass.  And were significant predictor variables describing the spatial and temporal variation in benthic community structure.  While a negative correlation between temperature and macroalgal biomass is often assumed to be due to nutrient availability, we argue this relationship might be partly attributed to other factors, such as temperature effects on trophic interactions.

To assess the perceived value of LTEES for advancing ecological understanding, we evaluated the relationships between citation rates and study duration, and the proportionate representation of LTEES in relation to impact factor of 15 ecological journals. We found the proportionate representation of LTEES increases with journal impact factor, and the positive relationship between citation rate and study duration is stronger as journal impact factor increases. LTEES therefore contribute disproportionately to the perceived value of articles in higher impact journals. We evaluated the perceived value of LTEES for informing environmental policy by comparing their representation in National Research Council (NRC) reports with that in the scientific literature.  We found that representation of LTEES in NRC reports was greater than in the ecological literature and that their authors particularly valued LTEES.

We found no change to the morphology of these receptors that could improve flow sensing. We tested whether the improvement in foraging could be a consequence of fish learning to sense prey. This was achieved by raising two groups of fish that were na?ve to the flow of swimming prey. One group was fed dead prey and another was raised with a compromised lateral line system. We found that both groups of fish foraged with a significantly lower rate than fish raised with exposure to flow of prey.

We found that the biomass of targeted species has increased consistently inside all MPAs in the network, with an effect of geography on the strength of the response. More interesting, biomass of targeted fish species also increased outside MPAs, although only 27% as rapidly as in the protected areas, indicating that redistribution of fishing effort has not severely affected unprotected populations.  Whether the increase outside of MPAs is due to changes in fishing pressure, adult spillover, favorable environmental conditions, or a combination of all three remains unknown.  We evaluated methods of controlling for biogeographic or environmental variation across networks of protected areas and found similar performance of models incorporating empirical sea surface temperature versus a simple geographic blocking term based on assemblage structure.

We tested predictions from metapopulation theory for giant kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera*a key habitat-forming species in temperate coastal ecosystems worldwidein southern California, USA, by combining a long-term (22 years), large-scale (> 600 km coastline), high-resolution survey of kelp biomass with novel patch-delineation methods based on spatial population synchrony and an innovative connectivity measure incorporating dynamic oceanographic transport and source fecundity. Connectivity strongly predicted local dynamicswell-connected patches had lower risks of extinction and higher probabilities of colonizationbut this relationship was mediated by patch size. Surprisingly, connectivity had a smaller influence on colonization relative to extinction, possibly because local ecological factors differ greatly between extinct and extant patches. We also found that temporal variation in fecundity, rather than dispersal, was the dominant driver of connectivity and a key determinant of local extinctions and colonizations.

The nearshore kelp beds, an important food source for abalone, have been drastically reduced by both the ""warm blob"" in 2014 and the strong El Niño in 2015. We recently observed red abalone searching for food, climbing up denuded kelp stalks, and competing with urchins for drift algae. The lack of food may negatively impact recent reproduction.  We examined gonad index at two sites in northern California in 2015 to compare with samples from normal ocean conditions.  We also compared the abundance of planktonic larvae (280µm), newly-settled individuals (280µm-2mm) from coralline-covered rocks, and juveniles (3-2-mm) from artificial reefs with prior normal years. Gonad indexes were dramatically reduced compared with past years. We also find that there are no larval or newly-settled abalone in 2015, and very few juvenile red abalone (from 2014), indicating the consecutive warming events have negatively impacted red abalone reproduction.

OA-driven changes to critical predator-prey interactions could result in community-level changes in intertidal systems. Because the physiological effects of OA on calcifying predators and prey can be complex, it is difficult to predict the magnitude and direction of change. Using an OA mesocosm, we tested the effects of increased pCOsub(2) on the feeding rate of two whelk predators (*Nucella ostrina* and *N. canaliculata*) on their mussel prey (*Mytilus trossulus*) at three treatment levels: low pCOsub(2) (target pH=8.16), mid pCOsub(2) (target pH=7.72), and high pCOsub(2) (target pH=7.51). We found that both whelk species reduced drilling of mussel prey as pCOsub(2) increased (pH decreased). During the two-week experiment, whelks in the highest pCOsub(2) treatment reduced drilling by 61% compared to those in the low. Despite consuming fewer mussels, whelks added greater total shell length with increased pCOsub(2), indicating the potential for temporal tradeoffs in growth and predation.

Vessels coated in copper anti-fouling paint act as numerous mobile, heavily contaminated sites for marine epibiota, selectively transporting copper-tolerant species between contaminated port and harbours. We examined how diffuse (non-localised) tolerance may contribute to bioinvasion by testing the relationship between copper tolerance and marine bioinvasion at a regional scale (99 sites over 7 estuaries). Invader abundance and diversity were positively correlated with environmental copper, and invaders were 60% less sensitive to copper than native or cryptogenic species.

First, we compared foraging behavior and habitat use of western gulls (Larus occidentalis) breeding on one offshore colony (Southeast Farallon Island, SEFI) and one nearshore colony (Año Nuevo Island, ANI) in central California. Results indicated that gulls breeding on ANI traveled to refuse sites more frequently (>40% of all foraging trips) and ate more refuse (27% of wet diet) than gulls breeding on SEFI.  Based on gull tracking and diet data, we also predicted that gulls breeding on nearshore colonies have a lower contaminant load than gulls breeding on offshore colonies due to biomagnification. Gull eggs collected in 2013 from 2 offshore colonies (Anacapa Island and Santa Barbara Island) and 1 nearshore colony (NAS North Island) in the Southern California Bight were analyzed for a suite of PCBs, PBDEs, and organochlorines.

By altering the functions describing the distribution of offspring among the generalist and specialist compartments, we present results pertaining to three mechanisms for the cross-generational inheritance of prey preferences: 1) random inheritance, 2) Mendelian inheritance, and 3) inheritance based on relative fitness among the compartments. We also investigate the influence of the cost of generalization due to tradeoffs involved in consuming multiple prey. We show that top-down control of prey decreases with an increasing cost of generalization, but the manifestation of this effect depends on the underlying mechanisms of diet specialization.

Under field conditions we asked how digestive strategies are related to microhabitats along gradients of food availability and thermal stress by using digestive enzyme activities as markers of digestive strategy. We predicted that populations in wave-sheltered- high-intertidal areas where temperatures are high and food availability low are bioenergetically challenged more than those in other spatially separated microhabitats (including wave-exposed-high-intertidal areas).

Understanding how dogwhelks may have adapted their drilling ability to seawater carbonate chemistry can tell us about the capacity for marine predators to evolve in response to ocean acidification. Drilled mussel shells were collected among dogwhelk populations next to intertidal pH sensors at four sites in Oregon and California. Shells were characterized for size, thickness, borehole diameter, and borehole location. Size and borehole diameter were smallest at the northernmost site and largest in northern California. Borehole diameter was smallest at the northernmost site, indicating dogwhelks were smallest at this site. Boreholes were disproportionately more common in the anterodorsal quadrant of shells at two sites. pH was the most variable at the northernmost site. Dogwhelks at this northernmost site may have adapted to excessive pH variability and taken advantage of the differences in mussel shell properties.",Evolutionary Biology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Consistent with the extended planktonic larval phase of all three species, previous studies based on allozymes depicted panmictic populations, with little evidence of genetic structure. In this talk, I show how the application of next-generation sequencing approaches reveals a subtle, but potentially important pattern of isolation-by-distance in populations of *A. elegantissima* ranging from Washington to southern California. Moreover, the markers also identify several outlier populations that do not conform to the IBD pattern, and are genetically distinct. Given the enormous range of environmental conditions that *A. elegantissima* experiences at multiple spatial scales, from centimeters to thousands of kilometers, and its critical endosymbiosis with *Symbiodinium* and *Elliptochloris marina* the existence of genetic structure in the host member of the holobiont may have important implications for the co-evolutionary interactions between hosts and symbionts, and the capacity for the holobiont to respond to strongly varying selection regimes over a range of spatial scales.",Molecular Biology,Evolutionary Biology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

This work focused on communities of semi-cryptic fish and invertebrates closely-associated with *Pocillopora meandrina* (POME). Communities were surveyed within 752 POMEs over 19 sites around O'ahu. Additionally, communities within 20 POMEs at two sites were followed for 14 months. Although 95 different species were identified, most species were rarely observed (32 species on ?1% of corals). Environmental variables specific to the host coral colony (e.g., coral size, percent live coral tissue) were highly correlated with community composition. Lower species turnover was observed within POMEs over time than between different POMEs at the same time. Species co-occurrence analyses identified more positive than negative species pairs, with a few species consistently associated with most of the negative species pairs. These results suggest POME community composition is strongly influenced by host coral quality and species interactions.

In recent years, underwater video has risen in popularity as an additional tool to quantify fish community structure. However these approaches are inherently limited. Extractive methods fail to capture changes over fine temporal scales, and visual surveys are limited by environmental conditions and personnel endurance. Underwater video is also subject to lack of light, water turbidity, and the dubious effects of artificial illumination. To overcome these limitations, we utilized an acoustic imaging camera (ARIS 3000, SoundMetrics Inc.), which can operate regardless of light or water turbidity, to quantify changes in fish community structure. In August of 2014, we deployed ARIS in a subtidal seagrass habitat (Phyllospadix spp.) off of Hopkins Marine Station, for two continuous ~70 hour periods. Fish community structure changed significantly over time.  Abundance rapidly increased at sunset each day, and was on average 5 to 10 times higher at night than during the day. Although mean size did not vary to the same degree, a slight increase in mean length around dusk suggests visual predators may use this period to prey on the small fish migrating into the system, presumably to forage during nighttime hours.

The lower end of the food web of these highly productive ecosystems has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effects of top-level predators and macroherbivores.  We assessed whether fish assemblages and eelgrass habitat metrics differed amongst 4 sites on the western, leeward side of Santa Catalina Island.  There were significant differences in the densities of the two numerically dominant carnivores, juvenile Paralabrax clathratus (kelp bass) and Haliochoeres semicinctus (rock wrasse), although total densities of all fish species combined did not differ among sites.  Eelgrass shoot density and mean blade length, also differed among sites, however these differences did not correlate with differences in densities of kelp bass or rock wrasse. From a conservation standpoint, this result is reassuring because sites with less complex habitat (shorter and sparser eelgrass) were still able to support relatively high fish densities.

Conversely, organisms released from natural enemies may experience enhanced growth and fecundity. This ""enemy release"" may explain why some introduced species flourish in new places. Red mangroves (*Rhizophora mangle*) were introduced to Hawai'i over a century ago; mangroves exhibit rapid growth, high fecundity, and create dense thickets that dramatically alter Hawaiian ecosystems. To test the hypothesis that invasive mangroves experienced a release from consumers, we compared mangroves at multiple sites within the native (Caribbean-Florida, n=10) and introduced range (Hawai'i, n=10). At each site, we measured damage on leaves, twigs, buds, roots, and propagules from brackish fringe mangroves and conducted visual surveys for herbivores. Our results support the hypothesis that Hawai'i mangroves benefit from the absence of consumers compared to mangroves in  native ranges. Introduced mangroves experienced lower herbivory in leaves (3 vs. 86%), buds (0 vs. 8%), twigs (10 vs. 27%), roots (0 vs. 94%), and propagules (0 vs. 26%) and harbored substantially fewer herbivores than native mangroves.

Already, several native fishes in the Bay-Delta system have been in decline; however, it remains unclear how further temperature stress may contribute to these declines. The threatened longfin smelt (*Spirinchus thaleichthys*) and critically endangered delta smelt (*Hypomesus transpacificus*) are of particular concern in California. In efforts to forecast how increased temperatures may impact these fishes, we measured upper temperature tolerance (CTMax) and whole-fish oxygen consumption rates (MOsub(2)) at 14°C and 20°C in both species at 50-dph, a vulnerable developmental stage. Delta smelt had a higher CTMax (27.6°C) compared to longfin smelt (24.8°C). MOsub(2) was greater in delta smelt exposed to 20°C compared to 14°C, reflecting an increased energetic cost at warmer temperatures. In contrast, longfin smelt MOsub(2) was similar at 20°C and 14°C, suggesting these fish may have limited capacity to adjust their physiology to elevated temperatures and there may be a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply at this early larval stage.

They consume algae that compete with coral for space on the benthos and facilitate coral settlement by scraping bare spaces on the reef.  It has been demonstrated that the spatial patterning of herbivore foraging may be an important determinant in the trajectory of coral reef benthic state.  In order to evaluate the relative roles of competition and predation risk in structuring the foraging habits of territorial parrotfishes we conducted a comparative study of foraging areas and feeding rates of a common and widespread Pacific parrotfish across sites at Palmyra Atoll (high predator and herbivore abundance) and Mo'orea, French Polynesia (low predator abundance and moderate herbivore abundance).  We found that while daytime predator abundance has an effect on foraging rates, variation in the spatial patterns of foraging is primarily explained by competitor abundance and habitat characteristics.   Because herbivore and piscivore populations are sometimes independently managed on coral reefs, it is important to understand how variation in these different populations affect important process such as herbivory.",Community Ecology,Behavioral Ecology,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

While the importance of herbivores to coral reef benthic communities is no longer in question, we currently know very little about how the strengths of consumer effects varies at different points in succession. If the herbivores in a system exert their greatest influence on early successional stages, but are unable to control late successional stages, the positive indirect effects of herbivores on coral recruitment and growth may be limited. This could also lead to a potential hysteresis or lag in the algal response to herbivory  where higher herbivore pressures are required to limit late successional stages than early stages. To determine how the effects of consumer pressure vary at different stages of algal succession, we manipulated 1) herbivore pressure and 2) the initial algal community in field experiments in the lagoon and fore reef habitats of Moorea, French Polynesia. Results from the two-year study suggest that herbivores may have differential abilities to exert top-down control of algal communities depending on the developmental stage of the algal community, however, these results were spatially variable within the reef habitats of Moorea.",Community Ecology,Plant/Algal Biology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Thus, contrasts of SDC taxa offer an opportunity to estimate the effect size of life history traits (such as fecundity and pelagic duration) on gene flow and to explore the magnitude and causes of residuals. Furthermore, meta-analyses of SDC contrasts facilitate comparisons among studies and regions. Here, we apply the SDC study design in three situations: along the coast of California, in the marine lakes of Palau, and in a meta-analysis using pairs of SDC taxa in marine and terrestrial environments globally. In large continental-type settings, we find a generally clear and consistent relationship: contrasts in gene flow can be explained largely by contrasts in dispersal-linked traits and/or their co-correlates. However, several departures from that trend appear to occur in island settings. In the island-like settings of Palau?s marine lakes, large residuals suggest substantial effects of factors including genetic drift, natural selection, and trait-environment interactions.",Dispersal and Recruitment,Population Biology and Ecology,,,No

Increasing ocean temperatures have already begun facilitating the movement of tropical marine herbivores and seaweeds into temperate systems with consequences to ecosystem dynamics, function, and productivity. In an effort to gain insight into the seaweed-herbivore interaction over a latitudinal gradient, we assayed the palatability of 50 seaweeds (31 Rhodophyta and 19 Phaeophyta) collected from polar (Antarctica), temperate (California), and tropical (Fiji) locations to generalist crab and urchin herbivores. Overall, seaweed palatability was found to increase with latitude. This latitudinal increase in palatability is largely explained by the response of urchins to Rhodophytes. Some of the latitudinal increase in palatability was attributable to latitudinal increases in nutritional content. However, a residual analysis indicated that tropical Rhodophytes were significantly less palatable than expected, suggesting that an undescribed component lowered their palatability. To our knowledge, this represents the first study to directly assess palatability of any primary producer group across a broad latitudinal gradient.

We therefore examined oxidative stress and exoskeleton structure, mineral content, and material properties of  *Neogonodactylus bredini* under OA and OW conditions. Mantis shrimp were maintained in three treatments for six months: ambient pH and temperature (7.9, 27°C), reduced pH and ambient temperature (7.6, 27°C), and reduced pH and increased temperature (7.6, 30°C). Contrary to previous studies on intertidal organisms, neither enzymatic indicators of oxidative stress nor exoskeleton calcium content showed significant changes in response to OA and OW. The predatory appendage, however, had significantly higher %Mg in reduced pH conditions, but there were no differences in exoskeleton stiffness and hardness. Thus, unlike other intertidal crustaceans, mantis shrimp tolerate expanded ranges of pH and temperature without experiencing oxidative stress or changes to the exoskeleton.

Lastly, I will establish whether marsh periwinkles, which are a common species throughout salt marshes, prefer salt marshes or black mangroves as their habitat and food source.

Crab cue inhibited shell growth in *N. canaliculata* and *N. ostrina*, especially at higher immersion times. Immersion time also affected body tissue mass. All three species only exhibited increased somatic tissue mass at 75% and 100% immersion treatments, and only if crab cue was absent. Shell lip thickness, a characteristic that protects *Nucella* from crab predation, was affected by immersion time and crab cue. Each species had the greatest increase in lip thickness in the immersion treatment representing its native tidal height, although only *N. lamellosa* responded to both crab cue and immersion time. Thus, *Nucella* species respond differently to crab cue and their responses are affected by immersion times, especially those that are similar to the immersion time each species typically experiences.",Intertidal Ecology,Invertebrate Biology,,,Yes

Yet this binary view of coral reefs is limited in that it does not consider the underlying processes and complexities of the ecosystem that might relate to the resilience of the coral or macroalgal dominated states. Therefore, there is a need to better describe coral reef ecosystems in terms of the communities that compose them, especially considering the functional roles of ecosystem components that confer resilience. This study employs cutting edge statistical techniques and a massive dataset to reveal five unique coral reef regimes that incorporate both fish and benthic assemblages. Regimes are then mapped to understand the spatial distribution and variation in reef regimes across the Main Hawaiian Islands. Next a set of hypotheses was developed about ecological processes related to coral reef resilience and compared across regimes. The outcome is a step toward practical implementation of ecosystem-based management at a scale that is useful for understanding the effects of human drivers of coral reef ecosystem decline.",Community Ecology,Ecosystem Assessment,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Yet, 75% of crabs in this superfamily behave similarly by decorating their carapaces and appendages to camouflage themselves and avoid predation (Hultgren and Stachowicz 2011). On the Eastern Pacific coast, the masking crab *Loxorhynchus crispatus* is often decorated with the same bryozoans, tunicates, sponges, and various algae, despite any variation in the abundance of these taxa throughout its habitat range (Wicksten 1978). This general trend might suggest that the crabs are preferentially choosing these taxa for decoration, yet such selectivity was unexplored in previous studies. Additionally, it is not known whether the decorative organisms benefit from living on this mobile environment, a condition for mutualistic symbioses. As crabs decorate themselves, they could either facilitate or inhibit the well-being of the selected organisms. Thus, this study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that the crabs are targeting their decorative organisms in a non-random way, and (2) are there measurable benefits or costs for organisms inhabiting a crab carapace?

Ice scour opens patches for development of alternative states, and in 1996, experimental clearings were established to mimic ice scour.  Half of the plots were re-cleared in winter 2010-11.  Recruitment data for barnacles, mussels and fucoids collected from 1997 to 2012 were used to (1) estimate sources of variation, (2) test the prediction that the past does not predict subsequent recruitment, which would be expected for alternative states, and (3) fit data to a cusp catastrophe.  Barnacle and mussel recruitment varied among years and sites, and showed consistent long-term patterns with respect to clearing size.  Average recruitment prior to re-clearing predicted recruitment afterwards.  In contrast, over 50% of the variance in fucoid recruitment was unexplained, and past fucoid recruitment was a poor predictor of subsequent fucoid recruitment.  The fitting of recruitment and abundance data to a cusp catastrophe revealed alternative states that were defined by fucoid recruitment.  The unpredictability of fucoid recruitment suggests development of alternative states is highly dependent on starting conditions that vary on a very small scale.",Community Ecology,Dispersal and Recruitment,,,No

Here we evaluate the responses of birds to variation in biodiversity, abundance and biomass of prey resources and in habitat features for two important coastal ecosystems, sandy beaches and rocky intertidal shores, in southern California. Our results suggest that variation in 1) connectivity with kelp forests that affects the availability of wrack subsidies and 2) the diversity and abundance of mobile invertebrate prey resources, can strongly affect the composition and distribution of shorebirds in sandy beach ecosystems. For rocky intertidal ecosystems, the distribution of wintering shorebirds responded to habitat connectivity and landscape features and to a few taxa of key rocky shore invertebrates.

Susceptibility of black abalone to infection by WS is related to higher body temperature variability during aerial exposure at low tide, suggesting that temperature stress is a key risk factor determining their long-term viability. Our research is designed to quantify how body temperatures and associated risk of disease to black abalone might be altered in response to anthropogenic climate change. We created a heat-budget model for black abalone and coupled it with long-term meteorological records at Hopkins Marine Station (HMS) to generate information about environmental and topographic controls of body temperature at this site. We simultaneously collected real-time data across microhabitats at HMS on the distributions of body temperatures (Tsub(b)) of live abalone with a calibrated infrared camera and operative environmental temperatures (Tsub(e)) with species-specific thermal mimics.

This variability suggests that we need to understand drivers such as human impacts to make sense of recorded changes in biodiversity. To evaluate the effect of different human impacts on local marine diversity, we performed a meta-analysis on a novel dataset of species richness change over time in marine ecosystems. Our dataset contained 400 sites from 117 studies of which 151 sites come from studies where direct impacts (e.g., dredging) that were explicitly identified by authors. We paired this data with large-scale drivers derived from geospatial databases: human cumulative impacts, climate velocity, invasive potential, and pollution. Our results suggest that changes in local diversity are driven by local events, climate, and species invasions. Our findings begin to explain the high variability observed in species diversity at local scales and reframe previous findings in a human context.

This ability to resist shifts between alternative community states, also called ecological resilience, can be strongly dependent on species interactions across trophic levels. Thus, investigation into how multi-trophic level fishery harvest can impact ecological resilience is needed. For example, predator-herbivore interactions on rocky reefs can potentially drive shifts between kelp forests and urchin barrens. We created a dynamic model of a rocky reef ecosystem with empirically-derived functional responses that describe the predator-prey interactions. Changes to predator (spiny lobster) fishing mortality allowed for alternative community states to exist, while manipulations of herbivore (urchin) fishing mortality did not. However, fishing for herbivores interacted with predator harvest to influence ecological resilience. Specifically, increasing urchin fishing mortality increased ecosystem resilience by reducing the range of spiny lobster harvest rates at which alternative states were possible. Therefore, even if increasing prey harvest does not alter community structure directly, prey harvest can be important to understand ecosystem resiliency and therefore the sustainability of both predator and prey populations.",Fisheries Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

In this study we established optimal concentrations to sedate Gopher Rockfish *Sebastes carnatus* to stage IV anesthesia using unregulated methods:  carbon dioxide (CO2), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and pulsed DC electroanesthesia.  Induction, recovery times, plasma cortisol, and survival rates were then compared to MS-222 to assess the efficacy and safety of these anesthetics.  All methods successfully induced and recovered fish from stage IV anesthesia; however, times differed significantly among treatments.  Cortisol levels were found to vary among treatments but tended to peak around 0.5 h post-sedation and return to normal levels within 2 h.  All anesthetics were effective at the concentrations used, short and long-term survival rates were high, and the cortisol stress response quickly resolved.

Between 1992 and 2014, community structure changed significantly, with macroalgae becoming more abundant, scleractinians remaining relatively uncommon (~ 4.5% cover), and octocoral abundance declining (to 2001) but then increasing; scleractinian cover did not precipitously decline as it has done elsewhere.  Taxonomic richness and diversity of octocorals and scleractinians increased following 2000, and multivariate community structure distinguished two domains of octocorals and scleractinians characterizing 1992-2001 versus 2002-2014.  Overall, smoothed temporal variation in multivariate community structure was associated with seawater temperature and rainfall, and smoothed variation in the octocoral community was associated with hurricanes.  Multivariate community structure was also associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) component of Atlantic SST.  The events affecting these shallow reefs may amount to a cryptic regime change that largely went overlooked by researchers focusing on scleractinians, and potentially was driven by local-scale phenomena involving chronic changes in temperature and rainfall, and regional-scale phenomena associated with the AMO.",Special Topic: Long-term Monitoring for Long term Change,Population Biology and Ecology,,,No

Reduced nuclear microsatellite diversity on the North American Atlantic coast is also consistent with a recent colonization event from the Pacific. Both mtDNA and nuclear microsatellite data show evidence for moderate gene flow from the western to eastern Atlantic, and high connectivity across the entire North Pacific. Recent collecting efforts suggest a decrease in abundance of *A. modesta* in eastern Europe, potentially as a result of climate warming.

In order to determine the potential for shifts in community interactions along the latitudinal geographic ranges of cosmopolitan species, we examined co-occurrences between endemic and cosmopolitan species. We surveyed species composition at eight sites along the California coast from San Diego to Cape Mendocino. Four sites were south of Point Conception and four sites were north of Point Conception, a major geographic biogeographic boundary for marine species that separates cool temperate waters to the north from warm temperate waters to the south. At each site, we randomly placed 10 transects perpendicular to the water line, then we identified species along each transect at 0.5-meter vertical intervals. To determine whether pair-wise interactions were significant, we compared the observed communities' standardized effect size to a null model to see which species occurred together more often than by chance. Our analyses suggest that negative interactions are more prevalent than positive interactions north of Point Conception, but the opposite is true south of Point Conception. This may reflect a shift in the relative importance of positive interactions in southern California's more thermally stressful intertidal habitats.",Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Here, we present the results of a coupled advection-diffusion and fertilization-kinetics model examining density-dependent fertilization of D. antillarum. Our model indicates that fertilization rates decreased from > 90 % prior to disease to < 5 % in the past decade and following the 2 mass mortalities events.

Many studies have shown that elevated dissolved seawater COsub(2) concentrations and associated decreases in seawater pH will have negative impacts on marine organisms that secrete calcium carbonate structures. Recent research has shown that decreased pH affects the behavior and physiology of several tropical and temperate fishes, but some species appear to be resilient to near future pH levels. We investigated how two early life history strategies of Central California nearshore rockfishes determine susceptibility to pH mediated behavioral and physiological impairments. We reared three canopy recruiting rockfish species and three benthic recruiting rockfish species in 4 pH treatments (8.0, 7.8, 7.5, and 7.2) for 3 months. During that time, we examined the effect of decreased pH on behavioral lateralization, critical swimming speed, and aerobic scope. We found that benthic recruiting species appear resistant to pH-mediated impairments while canopy recruiting species suffer behavioral and physiological impairments at low pH.

This study aimed to compare a historical set of Rosy Rockfish (*Sebastes rosaceus*) otoliths from 1980-1983  a period when fishing pressure for rockfish was high and steadily increasing  with otoliths collected between 2012-2014 to assess changes in size structure and growth parameters over the past four decades. Rosy Rockfish were chosen because fishers frequently encounter them, yet their growth has been poorly studied. My results demonstrate that within central California, the mean fork length of Rosy Rockfish is now four centimeters smaller than it was during the 1980s. In addition, mean maximum size and mean maximum age have also declined when compared to the 1980s. These changes are likely due to the intense recreational rockfish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s. These results are important because they demonstrate that even a small, less targeted rockfish species may be susceptible to both heavy fishing pressure and environmental changes.

Despite years of site monitoring, concerns remain about the resilience of the Dungeness to dredged material disposal as no direct observations of behavioral response to dumping have been made. This research addresses these concerns with video-based approaches to monitoring; specifically using benthic video sleds and baited video landers to monitor the distribution and behavior of Dungeness. Historically benthic monitoring used trawling and crab pots, but video tools may be effective alternatives that provide direct visual observations. The goals of this research are twofold: to determine if dredged material disposal affects Dungeness distributions and behavior at disposal sites, and to evaluate the effectiveness of video surveys to gain understanding of Dungeness responses.  Video sled footage has revealed unique species associations which would not be discernable from a trawl net haul.

However, in most deep subtidal environments, temporal and spatial patterns of detrital subsidies are unknown.  We characterized drift algal abundance in tow-camera surveys along 78 km of Nova Scotian coast (up to 120 m depth).  Drift was present in 25 % of video footage, but not uniformly distributed, tending to accumulate close to shore, in bays, and along margins of submerged shoals.  We also acquired spatial data on environmental factors that likely delineate suitable depositional areas, and used these to generate a predictive model of drift subsidy. The spatial pattern of drift was mostly explained by depth, distance from source, slope and bathymetric position (basin vs. ridge). We used our model to accurately predict drift in our study area, and in an area 50 km away, indicating it can be generalized along the coast.

Sea star health was monitored daily using a qualitative six-point scale (0 = healthy, 5 = limb autonomization or death). Coelomic fluid analysis and computed tomography (CT) imaging were used to quantify the effects of lowered water pH on physiology and ossicle density. *P. ochraceus* in OA conditions showed signs of accelerated wasting in preliminary stages of the trial, suggesting that stress from ocean acidification may be involved in causing or amplifying SSWD.",,,Yes,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),I am a student and am not eligible to judge

The driver for changes in path selection behavior is currently unknown. In this study, we examine the influence of food distribution on the path choice and homing frequency of L. scabra. Limpets were observed foraging on artificial environments which had an equal abundance of food arranged in high, medium, and low patchiness. Path selection and homing behavior were described. Some limpets, but not all, exhibited a statistically significant change in both path selection and homing behavior on different treatments, indicating that patchiness does affect limpet behavior. Limpets also tended to choose relatively simple paths while foraging and tended to moved their home scar to a large, proximal patch of food, possibly to increase foraging efficiency. In all of these behaviors, wide variability was observed between individuals, possibly due to differences in behavioral plasticity or individual personality.

Polar fishes are predicted to be especially vulnerable to climate change due to their thermal sensitivity, slow development, and shrinking habitat, yet the effects on early life stages are virtually unknown. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the impacts of near-future warming (-1°C, +2°C) and ocean acidification (420, 650, and 1000 µatm *p*COsub(2)) on survival, development and metabolic processes over the course of 3 weeks in early embryonic development in an Antarctic dragonfish, *Gymnodraco acuticeps*. Increased temperature had a greater overall impact on development and respiration than changes in *p*COsub(2) levels, suggesting that temperature may be the immediate driver of change at the organismal level. However, under ocean warming and acidification, there was a dose-dependent synergistic decrease in survival as well as interactions with development and subcellular processes, suggesting the potential for non-linear effects. In addition to implications for successful recruitment, alterations in development and metabolism due to ocean warming and acidification could have negative ecological consequences owing to changes in phenology (i.e. early hatching) in the highly seasonal Antarctic ecosystem.",Physiological Ecology,Fisheries Ecology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Removal resulted in over 14 million tonnes of sediment eroding from the former reservoirs and moving through and depositing in river, estuarine, and nearshore habitats. Sediment movement and deposition directly and indirectly affected the estuary ecosystem at the mouth of the Elwha River. Approximately one year after the start of dam removal tidal influence in the estuary was lost, resulting in rapid changes in salinity, temperature, and depth. In addition, water column turbidity increased two orders of magnitude in the estuary. This dramatic shift in water quality, along with substantial sediment deposition, altered the composition of benthic invertebrate and fish communities and fish diet.

Our top model included seven variables: year, timing, start time, aircraft type, aircraft category, altitude and distance; as well as the interactions between aircraft type and aircraft category, and between altitude and distance. The relative risk of disturbance varied from year to year, with 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exhibiting a greater risk of disturbance than 2008. Disturbance response was more likely during the pre-egg lay period and post-chick hatch period than during incubation. Helicopters were more likely to cause disturbance than fixed-wing aircraft. Displacement/flushing was more likely to occur at low altitudes and close distances. Our results support implementation of overflight regulations above DSR, similar to those in other coastal areas.",,,,,No

Although kelp forests are well-studied marine ecosystems, little is known about the role of California morays 'Gymnothorax mordax', as they are cryptic nocturnal foragers. To investigate the ontogenetic trophic ecology of California morays, we (1) used a Stable Isotope Analysis in R (SIAR) mixing model, with inputs from moray and prey tissues, to estimate contributions of prey to overall moray diet and compared these to estimates of prey abundance from stomach contents, (2) used Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R (SIBER) to compare isotopic niche breadth of morays through ontogeny, and (3) estimated within individual variation in diet by comparing stable isotope ratios of tissue types with different turnover times. Surprisingly, the SIAR and SIBER models suggest juvenile moray eels have a wide dietary niche, with individuals consuming fish, invertebrates and molluscs, or a combination of these sources, and this wide dietary niche was ontogenetically consistent. Nitrogen stable isotope ratios suggest that morays increase in trophic level through ontogeny likely as larger morays consume larger prey items, which feed at higher trophic levels themselves.",Community Ecology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,No

A few studies suggest that rhodoliths rely on hydrodynamic forces and bioturbation to maintain tissue, avoid burial, and reduce biofouling. We carried out two experiments in an oscillatory wave tank with rhodoliths ('Lithothamnion glaciale') from southeastern Newfoundland to test effects of 1) rhodolith density on rhodolith displacement on soft bottom at relatively high wave velocity [0.3 m s-1]; and 2) rhodolith density and wave velocity on rhodolith displacement and abrasion on hard bottom. Displacement was ?10 times higher on hard than soft bottom regardless of density. Abrasion on hard bottom increased with wave velocity, being 140% higher at 0.3 than 0.1 m s-1 regardless of density. Measurement of rhodolith displacement and water flow at 12, 16, and 20 m depths in a rhodolith bed showed wave-induced displacement at 12 m only, when flow exceeded 0.25 m s-1. A third experiment established that green sea urchin ('Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis') can greatly facilitate rhodolith overturning. Collectively, results provide the first quantitative demonstration that substratum is a major determinant of rhodolith displacement.

In this study we describe the utilization of intertidal habitat by the spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) inside and outside of a long standing MPA on Santa Catalina Island. Our results indicate that lobsters outside the MPA were greater in number and had a higher ratio of reproductively active females. This difference is suggested to be due to the presence of mussel beds outside of the MPA which comprised 75% of lobster's diet as estimated through stable isotope analysis. Through the application of landscape based survey methods we highlight how the performance of an individual MPA may originate at sub-meter scales via interactions between the underlying geological and biogenic habitat. We close with a discussion on the need to integrate landscape based survey approaches, assessments of sub-meter geological and biogenic habitat with, stable isotope analysis to move towards incorporating bio-energetic performance of MPAs into current assessments of MPA success.",Applied Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,,,Yes

Biodiversity surveys sample all species to assess community similarities among sites and document within-site community change over time. Core monitoring surveys target specific assemblages and species, such as ochre sea stars and endangered black abalone, to assess temporal changes. With these surveys, we can detect deviations in species abundances that are outside normal temporal and spatial variation. These data sets were critical in Natural Resource Damage Assessments (the Cosco Busan, Dubai Star, and Refugio oil spills) and for assessing impacts of urban runoff. Baseline data from these surveys were important for designing and evaluating California Marine Protected Areas, and documenting the presence and spread of invasive species as well as disease.

We conducted a field manipulation of food supply on the barnacle *Balanus glandula*.  We collected adult barnacles  and attached them to ceramic tiles placed at one of 4 shore heights, hanging from an unused wharf in the Port of Los Angeles, CA USA.  Tiles were grouped into three feeding treatments (fed, manipulated control, unmanipulated control).  To feed barnacles, we removed tiles at high tide and placed them in coolers of seawater and brine shrimp.  We followed growth and survival of the barnacles for 39 days, with supplemental food provided on 18 days.  Survival was significantly greater at lower shore heights, but there was no effect of feeding on survival.  Growth differed significantly among both shore heights and feeding treatments.  Food supplementation increased final mass by up to 36% over controls.  The feeding effect declined with shore height.

However, recent changes to structural and vertical complexity of algae due to the invasion of the low-lying *Sargassum horneri* may alter the recruitment of kelp-associated fishes. Through observations and experiments, our study examined whether the recruitment of a popular sport fish, kelp bass (*Paralabrax clathratus*), differed in abundance and strata in the water column between *M. pyrifera* and *S. horneri*. The abundance of kelp bass recruits was sampled on several reefs with naturally occurring *M. pyrifera* and *S. horneri*. Additionally, in an experiment, we measured kelp bass recruitment onto 3 transplanted algal treatments: 1) *M. pyrifera* alone, 2) *M. pyrifera* + *S. horneri*, and 3) *S. horneri* alone. Both observationally and experimentally, we found that kelp bass recruitment was greatest to *M. pyrifera*, but there were no differences in recruitment among strata in the water column.

We measured temperature and behavior to ask whether heat spells impede territorial behavior. During daytime low tides we artificially heated tagged limpets (25-35°C, vs. 15-24°C in unheated control limpets) in a shaded habitat and returned during the evening high-low tide to test for movement and territorialism.  Only 25% of experimentally heated limpets moved during subsequent evenings, while 70% of nearby unheated control limpets moved during the same observation period (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.015).  Correlations of territorial behavior and the temperature of those territories showed limpets in warm microhabitats moved less and were less aggressive than those in cool habitats.

We showcase a draft series of decision trees and questionnaires that managers can use to quantitatively or qualitatively measure both ecological and social outcomes, helping them to prioritize management options and limited resources.

However, this prediction is based on results from experiments in the Pacific Northwest, and the wide geographic extent of SSWD is an unprecedented opportunity to assess the generality of this fundamental ecological concept. We expect that the strength of the keystone effect may be tempered at locations with low mussel recruitment, high physical stress, or containing compensatory predators. To test the responses of more southerly intertidal communities to this unprecedented disturbance, we have formed a collaboration among 6 universities to assess the ecological consequences of the disease at 11 sites spanning from Central Oregon to Central California.

Composition of the water column microbial community was significantly altered by the screen, selecting for a common opportunistic pathogen, Vibrio. Effluence from corals had the greatest impact on altering the proportion of opportunists with a significant increase in Arcobacter, a rare bacteria in the water column that may have significant ecological relevance.

We use climate velocity trajectories, together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies. We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs through the year 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and changes in composition driven by the redistribution rather than loss of diversity. These invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and likely creation of novel communities where invasions are common. The overlap of these patterns with contemporary human impacts highlights where current action can help promote resilience to climate change.

We mapped gap formation in mussel beds over several years in Barkley Sound, BC, by creating GIS datasets of topography, wave speed, and mussel bed thickness, superimposed on georectified photo-mosaics.  Analysis showed that gaps formed in the central regions of mussel beds where conditions allow the bed to thicken into layers through mussel proliferation and growth. Superficial layer mussels attach to each other with no direct attachment to the rock. Deeper mussels weaken and lose attachment strength. More stable peripheral regions of the beds are continually thinned by physical and biotic stresses and thus gain protection from large propagating disturbances. Our findings indicate that mussel bed succession states do not occur as random mosaics generated solely through externally imposed wave forcing.

Over the six year study, the dominant juvenile flatfish captured has varied among speckled sanddab, butter sole, and Pacific sanddab. These shifting species compositions reflect year to year changes oceanographic conditions measured at the site. From a top-down perspective, these shifts have direct consequences for the benthic community as soles and sanddabs have different feeding strategies, thus differentially impacting the prey field.

To quantify tooth morphology, the length and width of each tooth was measured in the following five regions: inner maxilla, outer maxilla, ethnovomerine, vomerine, and dentary. Teeth located in the anterior portions of each region were regressed against head length (HL) to detect scaling patterns throughout ontogeny. We found that both length and width of the anterior teeth in all regions scaled isometrically with HL, indicating that tooth shape and relative size is maintained throughout ontogeny.

Calcifying organisms on northern California rocky shores are exposed to large changes in pH, temperature, and resources via seasonal upwelling, which could influence their allocation to growth and calcified structures. To begin to address this issue we examined variation in growth and performance of calcifying organisms in a tri-trophic food chain (predatory crabs-whelks-mussels) across nine sites that vary in their exposure to seasonal upwelling. Crab (*Romaleon antennarium*) body size and claw size were similar among sites. However, whelks (*Nucella ostrina*) had thicker shells and decreased body mass and mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) were larger and had thicker shells and higher attachment strength in areas of higher upwelling: patterns consistent with exposure to increased crab predation (whelks and mussels) or more abundant resources (mussels). These results indicate that despite expected negative impacts from episodic exposure to lower pH, other environmental factors may have stronger effects than pH stress on organismal performance and condition.

Little is known about how microalgal productivity will change in response to an increase in temperature variation, and understanding this response will be important in determining how broader marine communities might be affected if this key food source is reduced. To test how microalgae in the rocky intertidal zone would be affected by climate change, we measured the Net Photosynthetic Rate of microalgae grown under different temperature variability's and exposed to acute temperature stress. NPR was quantified with an infrared gas analyzer as the rate of COsub(2) uptake. NPR of Microalgae grown under different field temperature treatments, Low variability treatments had a greater difference in NPR compared to Normal and High (df=2,F=6.61,p=0.06).  NPR of Microalgae exposed to acute temperatures, Microalgae exposed to 18^oC and 24^oC had a lower change between pre and post photosynthetic rate, compared to plates exposed to 36^oC (df=15, F=3.81, p=.001).

Brachyuran crabs fill many ecological and trophic niches on reefs, making them ideal candidates for evaluating species composition among depths to ask if MCEs host the same communities as shallower reef communities that have been well-studied.

Glacial age refugia also drive genetic patterns of Q. y-cauda and G. mirabilis within the Gulf of California. Greater habitat and genetic continuity occurs along the more shallowly sloping bathymetry of the mainland coast while local glacial refugia and subsequent mixing between isolated habitats is evident on the steeper peninsular coast.

Previous work has established the importance of recruitment to recovery of the sexual deep water morphology. However, little is known about recovery patterns of the rhizomatous intertidal morphology. In order to address this deficiency, fifteen circular plots were established in an intertidal *Macrocystis* bed, with two clearings sizes (1.5m and 3m diameter) and three treatments (full removal, partial [frond] removal, and control). Full clearings were monitored by measuring encroaching growth of bordering individuals. Partial clearings and control plots were monitored by counting densities of (regrown) fronds. All plots were monitored for sexual recruits. Small clearings recovered significantly faster through rhizome encroachment than large clearings. However, frond regrowth was not seen in partially cleared plots, as rhizome death was observed shortly after fronds were removed. Finally, no sexual recruits were seen in any plot for the length of the experiment. The lack of frond regrowth indicates that vegetative individuals suffer after major biomass loss, possibly due to inadequate storage capabilities of the rhizome. Though rhizome growth was documented, it was slow, potentially leading to long recovery times for disturbed populations. Overall, the lack of recovery from cut rhizomes, slow encroaching rhizome growth, and absence of recruits indicate that these populations likely rely on pre-existing individuals for population persistence.",Plant/Algal Biology,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Although previous research has focused on physiological effects of OA, emerging evidence suggests that low-pH can also disrupt an organism's ability to respond appropriately to sensory cues. Such effects may influence not only individual species, but also interactions among species. Here, we investigated effects of low-pH on a food web, including a sea star predator (*Leptasterias hexactis*), an intermediate consumer (the turban snail, *Tegula funebralis*), and a common macroalga (*Mazzaella flaccida*). Results indicate that snail anti-predator behavior is impaired under low-pH. Prey remained below the water where (regardless of sea star sensory abilities), predators had a higher chance of encountering and capturing snails, which led to increased consumption of snails in low-pH. The altered behavior of prey also translated into a weakened trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII). Whereas snails held in ambient seawater grazed a reduced amount of algae in the presence of sea stars (characteristic of a functioning TMII), algal consumption was higher under OA conditions regardless of sea star presence (representing a weakened TMII). Although predation has been shown to be a major driver of community structure, our work suggests that seawater pH can impact both direct and indirect trophic interactions. As OA proceeds and conditions of reduced pH become more widespread, alterations in prey behavior could lead to unexpected community level consequences.",Community Ecology,Behavioral Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

The current population of 126 individuals expanded several miles up slough over three decades. Research on rocky substrate habitats show that size and abundance of preferred prey species is greatly reduced over time by sea otter predation, but very few studies have examined soft sediment communities, like Elkhorn Slough. To determine if prey profitability and prey species size varied spatially in response to temporal changes in foraging pressure, we divided the slough into eight areas and collected foraging data in each area for nine months. We calculated the average size for each prey species per foraging bout, and used this to estimate the mean rate of energy gain for each area. Our preliminary results show that prey profitability and mean clam size were significantly less near the mouth of the slough where otters have inhabited the longest. This suggests that continued sea otter foraging pressure may reduce size of preferred prey species in soft sediment communities, and therefore decrease prey profitability by forcing otters to switch to prey species with less caloric value.",,,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

In addition to regulating herbivore density predators may also elicit changes in the behavior of their prey. These non-lethal effects that decrease grazing rates thus leading to increased primary productivity are termed trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). There is evidence that TMIIs may be as or even more important in driving trophic cascades than DMIIs. We explored the role of TMIIs vs. DMIIs in the well described kelp forest trophic cascade (sheephead /spiny lobster - sea urchins - giant kelp) of the Southern California Bight (SCB). Surveys at 16 sites between Point Conception, CA and Punta Baja, Mexico described the relationship between the ratio of exposed vs. cryptic urchins and predator densities.  In the Point Loma, San Diego kelp forest 3 x 3 x 1.5 meter exclusion cages were used to test urchin behavioral response to the presence of each predator species. Grazing rates on pre-weighed giant kelp blades were used as a proxy for urchin behavior. These experiments were replicated in laboratory mesocosms of similar size to field treatments. The percent of cryptic urchins varied between sites but was most strongly correlated to lobster abundance. Both lobster and sheephead induced behavioral changes in urchins in experimental trials. The behavioral but non-mortality effects of lobster and sheephead on urchins in the SCB may explain the often high densities of cryptic urchins in MPAs that generally harbor increased predator densities.",Community Ecology,Behavioral Ecology,,,No

In earlier studies, we have documented high rates of bank erosion and vegetation retreat in Elkhorn Slough. We hypothesize that algal wrack is an important contributor to marsh loss near bank edges. First, we used historical aerial photos to characterize algal mat abundance over time. Our results suggest that wrack has increased concurrent with nutrient loading. Second, we conducted manipulative field experiments to determine the effects of wrack deposition on pickleweed. We found strong negative effects on percent cover of succulent tissue, canopy height, and flowering. Third, we monitored 15 marsh-bank edge sites to determine spatial and temporal variation in wrack deposition throughout the estuary. We found that some marsh edges in the lower estuary are subject to frequent burial by wrack, with negative consequences for marsh health.

The degree of openness has important consequences for population dynamics.  Populations that are more closed may have greater potential for stabilizing feedback because both population input and survival may respond to local density.  In contrast, populations that are more open may exhibit greater variability because input is unrelated to local density.  Pelagic larval duration (PLD) is thought to be a good proxy for dispersal distance, and therefore population openness.  If these two suppositions are true, then species with longer PLDs should have populations that experience weaker regulation.  I tested this idea by analyzing fluctuations in population densities for 23 species of fish at locations throughout California.  At the scale of local populations (reefs of 50-250 ha), species with longer PLDs exhibited greater variation in density.  Recruitment data were available for 16 species. Of these 16 species, 12 exhibited a positive relationship between local abundance of adults and future number of recruits, though species with longer PLDs were less likely to show detectable relationships.  These results suggest that even at local scales, self-recruitment may be common and that local reproduction may play a significant role in regulating population size.",Dispersal and Recruitment,Population Biology and Ecology,,,Yes

Tissue burdens of 4-NP detected in the intertidal arrow goby (Clevelandia ios) in California are among the highest recorded worldwide, however, it remains unknown whether these fish are impacted by this 4-NP contamination. 4-NP is an established endocrine disrupting compound with estrogenic properties that can alter reproductive function, but evidence that estrogens can also modulate iono- and osmo-regulatory function in fish implies that estuarine fishes exposed to 4-NP may also exhibit impaired ability to maintain hydromineral balance. Here, we examined the time course of detectable xenoestrogen biomarker responses to 4-NP in adult male arrow gobies, and also tested for impaired osmoregulation resulting from 4-NP exposure. Our data thus far suggests that 4-NP can induce moderate elevations in estrogen-responsive gene transcript levels in the goby liver, pointing to the utility of relative mRNA levels of these genes as accurate biomarkers for xenoestrogen exposure in this species.

Preliminary results indicate local and regional-scale variation in *P. ochraceus* size and morphology, with stars from upwelling sites having smaller bodies, narrower arms, and higher ossicle density than stars from low upwelling sites; findings inconsistent with previous laboratory studies that found increased growth but decreased calcification in *P. ochraceus* exposed to low pH. Because upwelling also influences productivity and temperature, complex effects of multiple factors are likely shaping star responses to low pH in the field; future studies will focus on disentangling these factors.",,,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Proper seagrass ecosystem functioning relies on an important relationship between seagrasses and small herbivores that feed on epiphytic algae that compete with seagrass for light and nutrients. Therefore, this ecosystem is strongly influenced by top down effects and biodiversity of the epifaunal community that inhabits seagrass habitat. Though many studies have focused on the direct consumption of herbivorous epifauna by predators, non-consumptive effects of predators (e.g. predator cues) may alter epifaunal feeding rates on algae. I hypothesized that the non-consumptive effects of fish predators on epifaunal grazing are mediated by seagrass structural complexity. I measured grazing rates of grass shrimp (*Hippolyte californiensis*) on epiphytic algae in a factorial lab experiment that varied the presence of predator cues (chemical cues from juvenile giant kelpfish *Heterostichus rostratus*: present or absent),and eelgrass *Zostera marina* structural complexity (low or high). I quantified loss of epiphyte biomass from eelgrass blades by measuring chlorophyll-a from scraped eelgrass blades. I found that grass shrimp consumption of epiphytic algae increased with seagrass structural complexity, but was not influenced by predator cues.",,,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Ten different wood types representing a wide range of structure from solid logs to bundles of branches with leaves were sunk to a depth of 3,100 m depth near Monterey Bay, CA. In total, 28 wood substrates were deployed on the deep-sea bed. After 2 years, the wood substrates were recovered and returned to the surface with over 7,000 attached or colonizing macroinvertebrates. All macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, including several species new to science. Diversity indices, multivariate analyses of variance, and indicator species analysis indicated that; 1) there was significant variation in the colonizing community assemblages among different wood types and 2) wood type accounted for approximately 70% of the variation. Although trends linking wood properties and the structure of the colonizing community were apparent, this is a complex system that merits further investigation to explicitly test the interaction of substrate complexity and functional traits of invertebrate colonists.",Species-Habitat Associations,Community Ecology,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Yet initial studies of mesophotic coral reefs (>30m) indicate vast reductions in herbivorous reef fish communities when compared to their shallow congeners.  Initial hypotheses regarding the reduction in herbivorous fishes with depth propose that 1) decreased light levels may reduce habitat quality, and 2) algal abundances are reduced or chemically defended on deep reefs.  We conducted surveys along stratified depth gradients in West Hawaii to assess variability in reef fish trophic assemblages and habitat with depth.  We then conducted algal transplant experiments to determine the palatability of common algal species in mesophotic depths.  Our findings support previous studies of reduced herbivorous reef fish abundances with depth, yet the absence of herbivores at depth does not appear to be associated with variations in habitat complexity or turf algal cover.  Instead, herbivore reductions were positively associated with reductions in coral cover, and negatively associated with increasing macroalgal cover with depth.  Algal transplant experiments revealed that deep algal species are edible and quickly consumed by shallow herbivorous fishes.  These findings suggest changes in herbivore populations with depth are more complicated than food availability or habitat quality previously hypothesized.",Community Ecology,Species-Habitat Associations,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

On the other hand, whether local dynamics in coastal systems can abruptly shift between alternatively stable states is questionable given that most recruits originate from subpopulations tens or hundreds of kilometers away. To explore this question, we built a simple tritrophic model of giant kelp, purple urchins, and predators in a local area, which exhibits two stable states - a forest or an urchin barren - when closed (no external recruitment). Indeed, we find that when a moderate proportion (20-30%) of new urchin and predator recruits originate from nearby kelp forests, this prevents predator extinction and the formation of barrens. However, in strongly open systems, urchin recruitment is sufficiently high to overcome natural mortality and predation, and urchin barrens may again occur. Overall, the levels of fishing of predators and openness in urchin recruitment have a greater effect on the occurrence of urchin barrens than openness in predator recruitment. These results can help determine areas where kelp forest communities are more prone to an abrupt collapse, and where management can help alleviate this threat by limiting predator fishing levels.",Dispersal and Recruitment,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Anthropogenic induced climate change is projected to surge pCOsub(2) levels resulting in decreased seawater pH. Upwelling is expected to increase in frequency and intensity with potential for rockfishes to have amplified exposure to hypoxic and corrosive waters both temporally and spatially. To determine the independent effects of these environmental conditions on physiological performance of rockfishes we reared newly settled juvenile blue (*S. mystinus*) and copper (*S. caurinus*) rockfish at four pH (7.2, 7.5, 7.8, 8.0) and four dissolved oxygen (2, 4, 6, 8.4 mg/l) treatments for 6 weeks.

Aerial images of the rocky intertidal zone were collected using a kite or a painter's pole.  Due to the relatively low height of the camera, the resulting resolution is high enough to identify not only substrate types, but also to observe organisms such as crabs, sea stars and anemones.  The images are stitched together into a 3-D model of the reef, which is georefereced and exported as an orthophoto.  The orthophoto is classified into substrate type, such as mussel beds and various algae families.  Once classified, the orthophoto can be further processed to determine the area and shape of mussel beds or the percent algae cover.

Results showed considerable spatial overlap between MPAs produced for fisheries and for biodiversity objectives; however, MPAs for fisheries were generally larger and less feasible.

In 2015, we tested disturbance to these invertebrates as large ships passed.  Remote underwater wide-angle-cameras placed near passing ships, generally showed ship hydrodynamics minimize such bottom disturbance, although narrow channels and side channels focus displaced water into brief erosional currents, although benthic individuals persisted.

But sites dredged most recently (~9 months earlier) also showed large populations and even large individuals of diverse invertebrates, approaching those in nearby, similar sites not dredged in >5 years.

In contrast, growth was lowest and predation vulnerability was highest in locations where frequent exposure to high pCOsub(2)/low pH seawater was decoupled from high food availability or in locations with exceptionally warm low-tide temperatures.

Polyandry may benefit females by increasing offspring heterozygosity or intra-clutch diversity. Hermaphrodites often express male-advantage traits such as traumatic mating, but few studies have examined whether hermaphrodites adjust their female function to exploit benefits of polyandry. We measured fitness effects of polyandry in two sea slugs (*Alderia willowi* and *A. modesta*) in which mating by hypodermic insemination imposes high costs, and inbreeding may occur early in colonization events. In both species, significantly more eggs were laid in polyandry treatments, indicating slugs capitalize on insemination by multiple mates by increasing short-term reproduction. Polyandrous slugs also produced larger larvae than monogamous slugs, suggesting fitness benefits for offspring. Due to costs imposed by penial armature, egg production decreased in proportion to mating frequency for monogamous slugs, whereas polyandry rescued the fitness of slugs in high-frequency mating groups. Finally, polyandry offset costs of inbreeding depression among lab-reared half-siblings, which produced significantly more eggs and had increased hatching success compared with monogamous half-siblings.

One of the most profound threats to this species is ocean acidification (OA), the decrease in seawater pH due to absorption of anthropogenic COsub(2), which has been shown to reduce calcification in a wide number of marine species. OA studies on *L. pertusa* are critical in determining the viability of this species and its associates in future oceans. Six distinct genotypes of *L. pertusa* were exposed to two pH treatments (pH=7.60, and 7.90) over a long (six month) experimental period, and to three pH treatments (pH=7.60, 7.75, and 7.90) over a short (two week) experimental period. During the short-term experiment, corals grown in low pH seawater generally exhibited net dissolution of skeletal material (-0.18% day^-1); however, one genotype exhibited net calcification (+0.04% day^-1). Results of the long-term experiment confirmed that the same genotype maintained positive net calcification longer than other genotypes in the low pH treatment.

In Hawai'i, runoff, and thermal stress are some of the main physical stressors on coral reef communities. Successful reproduction and recruitment is important in promoting reef resilience and recovery. While the impacts of sediment, salinity, and temperature on adult corals have been extensively studied, their effects on fertilization of Hawaiian corals remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that fertilization would be negatively affected by high sediment concentrations, low salinity, and high temperature at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology in Kane'ohe Bay. In June and July, we collected sperm and egg bundles from the dominant Hawaiian coral, *Montipora capitata*, and determined fertilization success in various treatments. Fertilization success varied among treatments. Both the low salinity and high temperature treatments significantly decreased fertilization success; however, fertilization did not differ among the sediment treatments. This study suggests that fertilization of 'Montipora capitata' is successful under high sediment concentrations but extreme temperature and salinity negatively affect fertilization. Kane'ohe Bay is a highly sedimented environment and further studies are needed to ascertain whether adult colony adaptation to sediment is influencing fertilization resilience to suspended sediment.",,,Yes,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Most research on internal waves has been conducted over smooth bottoms, and interaction with kelp forests/rocky reefs have been largely unstudied.   Here we present an internal tide pool phenomenon, where internal wave relaxation leaves pools of dense hypoxic water retained in depressions in the subtidal reef.  We show that following an internal wave event, the recovery of oxygen and temperature within these depressions to pre-event levels, can be delayed by 6+ hours behind the water column as a whole, during which, oxygen and temperature inside the pool may differ from surrounding areas by 5mg/L and 3°C respectively. This delay is strongest in areas of greatest concavity (""bowl-shaped"").  Further, we show that this delay, is a direct result of pooling of  dense hypoxic, water within these depressions,  i.e. salinity and flow patterns indicate that upwelled water settles within topographical depressions and slowly drains along topographic contours.  Finally we show that the diversity of pooling topographies within a small area creates a highly patchy dissolved oxygen landscape following a water column hypoxic event, where, across a small spatial scale, individual depressions in the reef may vary widely in their instantaneous oxygen and temperature content, which is very likely to impact habitat quality, species distributions, and efficacy of marine protected areas.",Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Species-Habitat Associations,Yes,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Using band transects and surveying equipment we quantified the presence of symptoms and the tidal elevations of individual stars. We found that SSWD had no effect on the stars' elevation. These results suggest that within sites, SSWD is randomly distributed across tidal elevation. Because the potential causative agent is found throughout the environment, this may also suggest that stars may not actually be healthy as suggested by the categories of disease, rather they are asymptomatic.

Eight samples were collected from marsh habitat that was only *S. alterniflora* while 16 samples were collected from marsh habitat that also had black mangroves present. Organisms from each sample were identified to the lowest taxonomic unit possible, measured, and counted. Initial finding show a seasonal pattern with total organismal abundance and shrimp abundance higher in *S. alterniflora* only marsh in the summer and both shrimp and fish abundance higher in S. alterniflora in the fall. However, fish abundance was significantly higher in black mangrove marshes during the summer. Overall, when black mangroves were not present or nearby, secondary production was found to be higher in *S. alterniflora* marshes.

Because the ecological consequences of hypoxia have mainly been studied in bays, estuaries, and infaunal systems, the effect of hypoxia on species interactions in open-coast systems, such as California kelp forests, is not well known. Purple and red sea urchins play a key role as grazers in kelp forest ecosystems, and have contributed to kelp deforestations in multiple parts of the California Current. Their relative abundance and population structure varies throughout their range. We quantified the grazing responses of different size classes of red and purple sea urchins on giant kelp under different levels of dissolved oxygen. Sea urchins of all species and sizes significantly reduced their grazing at sublethal (<4.6 mg/L) dissolved oxygen levels. However, response magnitudes and response thresholds varied between urchin species and among different size classes of urchins, suggesting that there is inter-specific and intra-specific diversity in hypoxia responses, and that variation in species compositions and size distributions of urchin assemblages may influence the impact of hypoxia on kelp forests in the California Current system.",Community Ecology,Physiological Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

To fill this knowledge gap, we first quantified and compared the feeding behavior of six parrotfish species in the *Scarus* and *Sparisoma* genera by conducting fish follows, benthic surveys, and fish surveys at three study sites in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Our preliminary results show large differences in diet, substrate preferences, and grazing rates among species and between genera of parrotfishes. We will use this data to quantify the ecological function provided by the parrotfish assemblage, based on species- and size-specific grazing rates and grazing preferences. The final phase of this project will be to use our grazing metrics to model the grazing potential of a parrotfish assemblage and forecast the impacts of different management strategies on the ability of the parrotfish assemblage to control algae and facilitate the protection of corals.",,,Yes,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),I am a student and am not eligible to judge

When food abundance is low, the mouth structure, known as the Aristotle's Lantern (AL), increases in size relative to test diameter, when food becomes abundant, the lantern shrinks. We applied this proxy to a deep-dwelling species of urchin to test the widely accepted hypothesis that food availability is reduced with increasing water depth in the deep sea.  We compared ratios of AL jaw length: test diameter of *S. fragilis* urchins collected across a depth gradient of 90 - 1,100 meters. Ratios were compared across the following depth bins: Upper Slope (90-300m), Mid Slope (300-500m), and Outer Slope (500-1100m). We found that the AL jaw length: test diameter ratio decreases with increasing water depth, trend which is opposite to our initial hypothesis. Explanations may be a) food does not decline with water depth for this species or b) low pH conditions at 500-1100 m suppress the expected AL enlargement.

OA negatively affects crustose coralline algae (CCA), a major reef calcifying group on coral reefs. I tested the effects of OA and warming on three species of CCA found commonly on the back reefs surrounding Moorea, *Porolithon onkodes*, *Lithophyllum insipidum*, and *Lithophyllum flavescens*, using a factorial design with two pCOsub(2) levels (~400 and 1000 ppm) and two temperature levels (~27 and 30 °C).

There were significant differences in calcification and lateral growth between species (p=0.001). *P. onkodes* calcified most in all treatments, while *L. flavescens* and *L. insipidum* calcified at similar rates. There was an absence of an effect of pCOsub(2) and temperature or their interaction on lateral growth/calcification.

We examined how time-since-restoration impacts epifaunal richness, diversity and community composition by comparing beds built in 2013 and 2015 to one another, the donor, and a nearby control bed. The most recently restored bed had highest species richness and the greatest abundance of mobile epifauna such as amphipods and isopods. However, the donor bed had the highest diversity compared to all other beds. The restoration methodology involved transplanting eelgrass shoots from a donor bed into a recipient bed in small, evenly placed bundles, resulting in a temporarily patchy structure with potentially higher perimeter to area ratios. At time of sampling, the 2015 bed was still fragmented. Other researchers have observed a relationship between high perimeter to area ratios and high abundance of mobile epifauna, which may be driving the community structure of our most recently restored bed.",,,Yes,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

In order to monitor these spaces, scientists have used settlement plates to observe the recruiting fouling community.  Previous literature has shown that plates effectively capture the assemblage composition on artificial structure and nearby rocky reefs when movement, orientation, light exposure, and distance from the seafloor are matched between areas (Glasby 1999, Glasby and Connell 2001, Connell 2000).  However, few studies investigate how well these plates capture NIS richness as compared to nearby floating docks.  To investigate this we sampled three marinas in San Francisco Bay using settlement plates and diver obtained dock scrapings.  We found that the community composition and richness varied between marinas but that settlement plates captured a greater NIS richness than found on the docks.

Because the performance of an organism is influenced by the environment in which it resides, we investigated whether somatic growth of a common flatfish (English sole, *Parophrys vetulus*) was a suitable indicator of the physical and chemical environment of the Puget Sound marine ecosystem. Specifically, we investigated how otolith-derived estimates of somatic growth from juveniles collected at sites in Puget Sound vary with regards to environmental (e.g., water temperature) and anthropogenic (e.g., exposure to chemical contaminants) factors. Analyses indicated that juvenile growth rate was not significantly correlated to contaminant levels (e.g., PCBs, DDT, etc.) in tissues and sediment. However, we observed a significant relationship between growth rate and water temperature; fish collected in 2010 grew faster (0.72mm/day) than those collected in 2011 (0.39mm/day) where the average daily water temperatures were 14.1°C (0.87 standard deviation) and 12.9°C (0.87 standard deviation), respectively.

The prediction system utilizes an Arduino microcontroller programmed to generate real-time tide predictions from the user's chosen NOAA tide station without the need for a computer or network connection, and a motor-driven rack continuously manipulates drain heights of aquaria within the desired range of tide heights. We demonstrate the use of the THC system to monitor growth rates of *Spartina foliosa* marsh cordgrass growing at three different simulated estuary shore levels with naturally differing immersion and emersion durations. As emersion time increased, we observed a decrease in growth rates.

Much of our knowledge of coral reefs comes from areas that have a history of anthropogenic impact, and these confounding factors hinder our understanding of the role of natural variation in these systems.  A cruise to the Southern Line Islands, a chain of five remote and uninhabited islands that span a strong productivity gradient, was conducted to explore the influence of oceanographic variation on the trophic ecology of two common species of coral reef predatory fishes: '*Cephalopholis urodeta*', the dark-fin hind, and '*Paracirrhites arcatus*', the arc-eye hawkfish.  During this cruise, individuals (n = 27-40) of each species at each island were collected and stomach contents were analyzed for each individual.  We hypothesized that primary productivity would be the largest driver in differences of stomach fullness and dietary niche breadth for these species.  Diet and percent fullness vary among the islands for both species, and these differences appear to be driven by oceanographic variation among the islands.  Future work will increase the number of species examined and include stable isotope analysis to provide an additional metric for understanding trophic ecology of these fishes.",,,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

While the Maine scallop industry has clearly rebounded, there is concern that the population will not be able to maintain stability as the industry continues to expand. In the past five years alone, the number of active scallop fishermen in the state has nearly tripled. Thus, there is a call to generate a better understanding of the population dynamics of Maine?s scallops as literature in this area is currently lacking. In particular, there is no consensus on the major predators of the scallop population. We utilized field deployments of tethered giant sea scallops (*Placopecten magellanicus*) to identify the species' main predators and determine if the population is subject to size-specific predation.

Opposite cross-shore distributions of zooplankton occurred at the two sites: zooplankters were more abundant inside the wide surf zone at a moderately sloping shore with a system of rip currents, and they were more abundant outside the narrow surf zone at a steep shore where water exchange was reduced by half.

Beginning in Fall 2013, sea star wasting syndrome (SSWS) dramatically reduced Pacific coast sea star populations. Ochre stars, *Pisaster ochraceus*, act as keystone predators in intertidal communities by consuming competitively dominant mussels, *Mytilus californianus*, and opening space for other species to colonize. Experimental removals of *P. ochraceus* can produce mussel monopolies and cause competitive exclusion of other species. Spatial variability in SSWS severity gave rise to sites with different proportions of remaining *P. ochraceus* biomass, making it difficult to predict intertidal community responses to SSWS. We monitored mussel percent cover, lower limits of the mussel bed, mussel size, and community composition of intertidal sites in California and Oregon. We compared post-SSWS mussel beds and intertidal communities to pre-SSWS monitoring data. Mussel cover increased from pre-SSWS levels at two California sites. Bed lower limits moved downward at only one California site. We found no clear patterns of change in mussel girth.

Due to the spatially complex and dynamic nature of giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) forests, assessment of the abundances of giant kelp and amphipods through time and space should provide insight into their potential interactions. We quantified the abundance of amphipods on artificial substrates at 18 sites within the surface canopy of giant kelp along Point Loma, CA, USA from July - October, 2009 and 2010. We estimated biomass of giant kelp canopy using remotely sensed imagery, and compared the spatial synchrony (autocorrelation through time) of kelp canopy with synchrony of caprellid and non-caprellid amphipods. Caprellids exhibited high spatial synchrony that did not decrease with distance while non-caprellids were synchronous on local scales, indicating high spatial heterogeneity in abundance through time. Non-caprellids showed a rapid exponential decrease in synchrony that was consistent with synchrony of giant kelp. This suggests a local scale biotic link between non-caprellids and kelp canopy whereas caprellid synchrony is more likely to be influenced by regional scale environmental variables.

We estimated consumption rates by green crabs of four common rocky intertidal prey species: blue mussels, dogwhelks (*Nucella lapillus*), periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*) and barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*) in no choice and multiple-choice experiments. We also manipulated both crab and mussel densities to estimate per capita interaction strength of crabs on mussels and the extent of prey switching by crabs as a function of mussel density. Crabs predominantly consumed small mussels and small dogwhelks, but were able to consume a larger size range of mussels than dogwhelks. Few periwinkles and barnacles were consumed. Green crabs have the potential to strongly affect mussel populations especially by impeding successful establishment of new mussel recruits. Mussels and dogwhelks were eaten more with increasing crab density, although per capita consumption rates decreased. Consumption of dogwhelks increased when mussels were rare.

After this protocol has been established, five herbivorous fishes will be collected from locations throughout the Main Hawaiian Islands along a gradient of human impact, and the same methods will be applied to compare diet breadth.

While some studies have found that the patches play a role in male-male competitive encounters, others have shown that factors such as resident status or body size are more important signals in competition. The goals of this study were to describe the morphology and reflectance properties of the UV-blue spots in Podarcis muralis, and to study their influence (concurrent with size) on male-male resource competition combats.

From the 60's - 80's, marine ecologists working on rocky shores addressed this question through experimental manipulations that focused on subsets of strongly interacting species. Their results established the paradigm of local control of species diversity, where deterministic competitive hierarchies lead to local extinction unless prevented by predation or disturbance. Since the 90's, some of the same pioneering marine ecologists have led the way in showing us that, despite the recurrence of the predation hypothesis, the explanation is far from being an overriding mechanism controlling biodiversity in any marine community. The reasons are many and some are illustrated in this presentation:  1) predation-mediated and niche-based coexistence are possible in only a small subset of species. Dispersal-mediated coexistence at regional scales is probably a much more general mechanism. 2) competitive hierarchies are not universal among sessile, space-dominant species. Fairly ""neutral"" coexistence among competitors, passively following recruitment variation, may be more common than previously suspected. 3) both deterministic and neutral processes often appear to modulate local biodiversity when a large fraction of species are considered, instead of the few typically included in experiments",,,,,No

Besides changes in abundance, individual traits of habitat-forming species can affect whether or not it facilitates/benefits other species.  Surveys conducted along the central Chilean coast identified striking changes in kelp canopy condition that varied consistently with abundances of other key ecological players.  Sites characterized by large expanses of ""canopy"" kelp with lush, dense foliage maintain larger and higher biomass of reef fish; whereas sites dominated by ""skeleton-type"" kelp, denuded of foliage, present greater grazing snail abundances. Given the ecological importance of the kelp and that plants are heavily exploited by fishers, it urgent to understand processes controlling canopy traits and its consequences on the rest of the community. We show that, contrary to expectations, field settlement and recruitment of fish and invertebrates was greatly enhanced in ""skeleton"" kelp.  Experimentally evaluated fish habitat preferences showed that recent recruits display strong preference for ""Canopy"" kelp, but the presence of resident conspecific adults harboring in the canopy obliterates such preference.

Branch length, polyp density, and the number of terminal branches all scaled with negative allometry relative to colony height. Comparing these ontogenetic trajectories across species revealed similar slopes but different intercepts on log-log plots, indicating that the diversification of colony forms among octocoral species may have resulted from specific changes in the onset timing of polyp and branch development. Multivariate analyses of variation across all the colonies revealed strong covariation among the morphological traits. Independent of colony height, species with shorter branches tend to have thinner branches, higher polyp densities, and higher branching rates.

We developed a method to estimate demographic parameters (e.g., fishing mortality rate and larval recruitment rate) from time series of size-abundance survey data using a Bayesian state-space integral projection model, and then used those estimates to simulate expected trajectories of populations inside MPAs. We applied our method to data for two species (blue rockfish, *Sebastes mystinus*, and gopher rockfish, *S. carnatus*) at kelp forest sites inside and outside California MPAs in the Central Coast region, which were implemented in 2007. For both species, estimated pre-2007 fishing rates at each site deviated sharply from prior estimates based on coast-wide stock assessments. That departure reinforces the value of estimating demographic parameters from site-specific monitoring data. High pre-MPA fishing rates at some sites suggest a large eventual increase in population density within the MPAs.

In salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States, latitudinal variation in interactions among plants often leads to stronger competition at low latitudes and stronger facilitation at high latitudes. Plants in Pacific coast salt marshes may not follow this trend as dominant environmental stresses differ between coasts. We conducted a neighbor removal experiment at six salt marshes along the California coast to see if the effect of the dominant species on the rest of the plant community differed by latitude. Dominant species typically competed with subordinates, inhibiting their growth, while subordinate species had little negative or positive effect on the dominant. Unlike in Atlantic coast marshes, the strength of interactions did not vary latitudinally despite a large temperature and precipitation gradient, although there were differences among sites in the strength of plant interactions. We suggest that differences in interaction strength may be due to environmental conditions that vary locally rather than with latitude and that changing environmental conditions may not strongly affect species interaction strength in California salt marshes.",Community Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

While most studies highlight detrimental effects, acidification and eutrophication increase the concentrations of key resources for primary producers, allowing organisms like macroalgae to flourish. Here, we assessed how macroalgae and grazers respond to ocean acidification and eutrophication. We exposed *Ulva lactuca* and *Fucus vesiculosus* to high COsub(2)  (~1100ppm) and high nutrient conditions (~200UM TN), along with background levels of COsub(2) (~400ppm) and nutrients (10UM TN) in a fully factorial design, measuring growth, surface area to volume ratio, and tissue quality. We found that the opportunistic *U. lactuca* was able to thrive under the combination of high COsub(2) and high nutrients, exhibiting growth rates four times higher than the controls, while *F. vesiculosus* was unaffected by COsub(2) and nutrient addition. We also exposed a common marine snail, *Littorina littorea*, to the same experimental treatments, measuring consumption rates and feeding preference. We found that consumption rates decreased by 50 and feeding preference shifted from a mixed diet to feeding almost exclusively on *U. lactuca* under high COsub(2) conditions. Our findings indicate that higher growth rates in some macroalgal species, coupled with decreased consumption, could enhance macroalgal abundance in coastal ecosystems.",Community Ecology,Intertidal Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,No

By providing habitat complexity, macrophytes offer refuge from predators and food sources. However, nursery habitats are often evaluated on a single habitat basis, ignoring important seascape level complexity and connectivity. On the outer coasts of central British Columbia, seagrass and kelp forests persist in unusually close proximity, connected spatially and biologically. We examined how *Nereocystis luetkeana* kelp forests alter the nursery value of subtidal ?Zostera marina? to temperate fish communities. From April - August, we conducted dive surveys counting and sizing fish. Ecotones sites (n=4 of each) included seagrass sites adjacent to kelp forests and no vegetation, as well as within the seagrass interior. Overall, we found differences in species composition and size structure among the 3 ecotones types. Fish diversity and biomass were higher at habitat ecotones than interior seagrass sites. In particular, juvenile rockfish (*Sebastes* sp.) recruitment was higher at seagrass edges than interiors. Our findings suggest that marine habitat ecotones may be hotspots of biodiversity and can inform spatial planning of nearshore areas.

These marine closures attempt restoration of habitat and exploited fish stocks. MPAs are inherently controversial, depending on network design, they can affect the attitudes, behavior, and income of fishermen. This paper describes research focused on MPAs developed on the California North Coast. Working collaboratively with fishermen to gather socioeconomic information about the network, we explored fishermen's perceptions of the network management, the functionality of MPAs, and their knowledge about the local fishery ecosystems. Research is based on over 160 surveys with commercial captains, and five focus groups in the region's five main ports. This study will be integrated into a larger examination of the socioeconomic consequences of the Northern California MPAs.
Initial results indicate a lack of trust in management regimes and a dichotomy between local and scientific knowledge related to the design and function of MPAs. Management and conservation-based narratives predominantly informed the project, and resource user knowledge was dismissed as anecdotal. Results exemplify the need for a more integrative system of management incorporating knowledge and participation from local experts who work in these habitats daily and whose livelihoods depend directly upon marine ecosystem health.",Special Topic: Human Dimensions,Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Yes,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

CORAL SIZE STRUCTURE AS A REEF HEALTH INDICATOR,"Globally, coral reefs have exhibited drastic declines in coral cover due to bleaching, disease, and direct anthropogenic impacts.  Reports of coral demise often focus purely on total coral cover with little focus on demography of corals.  Size structure is often used to evaluate status of populations of concern and can indicate degree of impact as well as predict population trajectories.  Many coral monitoring programs collect such data; however, size structure may not be a useful indicator due to fragmentation, space competition and morphological diversity.  In order to evaluate the utility of size structure data for determining status of coral communities, we used data from two different monitoring programs, one in the Caribbean (Belize) where coral cover is low and one in the Indo-Pacific (Micronesia) where many reefs have high coral cover.  We found size structure of corals on low vs. high coral-cover reefs to be remarkably similar, with size structure skewed strongly toward small colonies.  Additionally, there is no clear relationship between coral density, coral diversity and coral size structure.  These results suggest that coral size structure may be a poor indicator of coral reef health, yet some aspects of demography may yield important insights for assessing coral reef health.",,,No,,Yes

However, reef seawater carbonate chemistry is strongly controlled by benthic net community calcification (NCC = calcification - CaCOsub(3) dissolution) and net community organic carbon production (NCP = primary production - respiration), which could alleviate or exacerbate OA. Therefore to predict OA on coral reefs, we must understand how benthic communities modify their chemical environment.  In mesocosm experiments, the influences of NCC and NCP on seawater carbonate chemistry for five distinct reef communities were measured under ambient conditions and OA.  Calcifying communities slightly influenced daytime seawater pH and aragonite saturation state due to balance of NCC and NCP.  In contrast, communities with non-calcifying algae elevated pH and aragonite saturation state due to high NCP rates.  Daytime NCC and NCP rates were not affected by OA but larger variations of pH and aragonite saturation state were observed due to decreased seawater buffering capacity.  At night, similar NCP rates and increased dissolution was observed under OA, resulting in similar influence on pH and aragonite saturation state between communities and across experiments.  These results show that non-calcifying algae and increased dissolution may partly alleviate OA in local or downstream environments.",Ecosystem Assessment,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

As part of the effort to better understand the status of this iconic species, we established a comprehensive statewide monitoring protocol to examine the abundance, size, and distribution of Pismo clams in their intertidal sandy beach habitat. We conducted surveys at over 25 sites between Santa Cruz and San Diego.  In general, the abundance of clams was similar between sites north and south of Point Conception, with the exception of one outlier site south of Point Conception (~10x the density of the next highest site). More recently, we have detected and are monitoring an unusual recruitment event at Pismo Beach. We also conducted a pilot study to examine size and density between intertidal and subtidal populations, the results of which have provided insights about how to proceed with continuous transect surveys from the intertidal to the subtidal, which will allow us to assess the entire population.

We addressed the question: how do microhabitats and thermal conditions differ across life stages of two intertidal marine invertebrates, the mussel *Mytilus californianus* and the barnacle *Chthamalus fissus*? To determine the age distribution of the study species across microhabitats, we quantified individuals of different ages (using size as a proxy) every 0.2 m in tide height along transects running perpendicular to the waterline. To assess age-specific variation in thermal conditions, we used *in vivo* thermistor measurements from 3 (high, mid, and low) tide heights within the species' distributions to compare body temperatures between juveniles and adults. Tide height distributions differences by age were more pronounced for *M. californianus* than for *C. fissus*. Interestingly, at tide heights where ages differed in thermal conditions, juvenile mussels experienced higher *in vivo* temperature relative to their environment than adult mussels whereas adult barnacles were warmer than juveniles.

Predator recovery can induce shifts in prey density, behaviour and trophic role, which could have emergent impacts on food web architecture and stability. In temperate nearshore ecosystems, recovering populations of sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) are well known to trigger a cascade of effects in nearshore community structure and productivity, yet their impacts on a consumer's trophic role remain less well known. Here, we use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures (?15N and ?13C) to measure the isotopic niche width of fish and invertebrates along a gradient in sea otter recovery and occupation time. We found no significant differences in the size and positioning of overall food web niche width among sites varying in otter occupation. This suggests that sea otters had a limited impact on overall rates of primary productivity in the kelp forest ecosystem of BC's central coast where a diversity of annual and perennial kelps dominate early and late occupation sites. This investigation of food web interactions adds to a growing body of information on the context-dependent effects of sea otter recovery on nearshore ecosystems.",Community Ecology,Species-Habitat Associations,Yes,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

While there remains little unifying or explicit theory addressing how various levels of diversity are driven concommitantly, using an island framework helps delineate such patterns. We compared genetic structure and community similarity in 15 island-like marine lake habitats across distinct environmental gradients. We used calculated Fsub(ST) for the COI genetic marker for up to 16 species and Bray-Curtis measures of dissimilarity from point intercept transects from ~400-1600 points per marine lake, to compare community composition to environmental variables and genetic differentiation. Relationships between species diversity and geographic distance in the marine lakes follow predictions for an island framework. However, trends between Fsub(ST) and community dissimilarity vary across compared marine lakes, potentially due to (1) strong selective effects overwhelming mechanisms of dispersal in shaping communities and (2) the relevance of difficult to measure stochastic processes. The results highlight the extent to which dispersal-selection balance shifts in response to local environmental heterogenity, and the unpredictability of drift in shaping marine communities.",,,,,No

Unfortunately, stock assessments of vermilions were confounded by the discovery of a cryptic species. Because of their high site fidelity and limited larval dispersal, vermilions show restricted gene flow indicating there are separate subpopulations. This study will investigate and clarify the age and growth data of the true vermilion rockfish in California. Vermilion rockfish will primarily be sampled by hook/line at depths <100 m to avoid catching the deeper-living cryptic species. Fish will be collected at four sites along California. Differences in the growth parameters among the sites and between the sexes will be assessed using fish lengths and otoliths. The von Bertalanffy growth function will be used to model somatic growth. Further exploitation of vermilion rockfish could reduce genetic diversity and shift demographics of this species.

In response to this need, we will synthesize and evaluate methods, utilized by the U.S. and international agencies, for quantifying uncertainty for data-rich and data-limited stocks. A meta-analytical approach will be used to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty in fisheries management systems can be quantified by synthesizing methods utilized within the U.S. and internationally. The goals of this meta-analysis are to 1) estimate the magnitude of the effect uncertainty has on the outcomes of stock assessments used globally; 2) assess and describe the heterogeneity between the assessment-specific estimates of uncertainty; and 3) identify and characterize factors that influence the between-assessment heterogeneity and the overall estimate of the effect uncertainty has on these international stock assessment outcomes.",,,,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Research from the Baltic Sea indicates a similar eelgrass trophic cascade mediated by other apex predators. An initial comparison of Southeast Alaska eelgrass extent in areas with and without sea otters found that areas occupied by sea otters support greater seagrass extent suggesting a sea otter- eelgrass link. We plan to investigate the geographic generality of the sea otter- eelgrass trophic cascade through a broad survey of eelgrass associated species including algae, invertebrates, and fishes across a gradient of sea otter occupation along with manipulative cage experiments.

Macroalgae may benefit from the increased dissolved carbon dioxide in the seawater because it is available by diffusion for use in photosynthesis. Increased availability of nitrogen from nutrient enrichment positively affects macroalgal growth rates often resulting in blooms and lower overall biodiversity. 
We investigated how ocean acidification and nutrient enrichment will affect the growth rates and photosynthetic and nutrient physiology of the green algae, *Ulva* spp. We used a state-of-the-art ocean acidification incubation system to grow *Ulva* sp. in pH 8.05, 7.85, and 7.65 under ambient and enriched levels of ammonium at 200 µm photons m^-2 s^-1 for one week.

Instead secondary production occurs via the detrital food web. Here, we study the roles of plant genetic diversity and grazer species diversity on detrital consumption in California eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows. We used three common mesograzers?an amphipod (Ampithoe lacertosa), an isopod (Idotea resecata), and a polychaete (Platynereis bicaniculata). Each grazer consumed detritus at rates greater than live tissue or macroalgae. This detrital consumption, however, was not spread evenly over different eelgrass clones. Palatability and consumption varied because of genotype specific differences in leaf texture, secondary metabolites (phenolics), and nutritional quality (nitrogen). Further, all grazers were not equal. Some genotypes were palatable to all grazers, while others were preferentially consumed by only one grazer species. Under monospecific grazer assemblages, plant genetic identity but not diversity influenced consumption. However, using more realistic, diverse grazer communities, increased plant genotypic diversity resulted in greater consumption and grazer survival. These results provide a mechanism for field observations of increased mesograzer density and diversity in genetically diverse seagrass assemblages and illustrate more broadly the emerging principle that biodiversity effects are strongest when environmental heterogeneity (the grazer community) is present.",Plant/Algal Biology,Community Ecology,,,No

Through the Zostera Experimental Network, we utilize this approach to study the community ecology of eelgrass (Zostera marina), the most widespread marine plant and foundation of important but threatened coastal ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere. In 2014, parallel field surveys and experiments were conducted at 50 field sites to measure correlations between mesograzer species diversity, eelgrass genetic diversity, predation pressure, and seagrass dynamics. Biodiversity was positively correlated with plant and grazer biomass across sites. Predation pressure in these systems decreased with grazer biomass and latitude. In subsequent experiments in 2015, predation and habitat complexity influenced the grazer community.

While abundances of long-lived fishes are slow to recover, marine reserves may rapidly increase predation rates by promoting the recuperation of bold phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate that marine reserves reduce fish flight from SCUBA divers and spearfishers. However, no studies have examined how reserves influence fish foraging in the presence of divers. To investigate this, divers conducted repeated disturbances of baited lines, and underwater cameras recorded fish feeding rates on bait during and after disturbances. Feeding rates were higher in old reserves relative to new reserves due to the presence of larger, bolder fishes. SCUBA divers initially delayed feeding at all reserves. However, after repeated disturbances, fish in old reserves habituated to divers and consumed bait more rapidly than fish in new reserves. Free divers reduced the time individual fishes spent at the bait line. These fishing- and diver- induced shifts in the behavioral composition and feeding rates of resident fishes variably influence the ecological role of these predators across reserves, such that measures of abundance may not be wholly sufficient to gauge ecological recovery.",Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Conservation and Resortation,Yes,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),I am a student and am not eligible to judge

The sea urchin *Lytechinus variegatus* is a dominant grazer that exerts strong top-down control on the biomass, diversity, and community structure of seagrass ecosystems from North Carolina to Brazil. Increasing SSTs may strengthen top-down control of seagrass by increasing urchin metabolism and consumption rates. Concurrent effects of OA can reduce seagrass nitrogen (N) content, a critical component of herbivore metabolism. Thus, under elevated temperature and fed low N diets, *L. variegatus* consumption rates are expected to increase to compensate for increased metabolic demand and reduced diet quality. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature (23 C, 27 C, or 31 C) and diet N quality (low or high N diets) on *L. variegatus* metabolism and consumption. Urchin metabolism was measured after 24 hours of acclimation to temperature temperatures and was highest at 31 C. Consumption was measured as the mass difference between seagrass-based artificial diets over a 24 hour feeding period.

Here we assessed the aggregation patterns of an omnivorous ladybeetle under field conditions to patches varying in prey and non-prey availability.  Adult ladybeetles preferentially aggregated to patches containing scale insect prey, regardless of the presence of cordgrass pollen, indicating that scale insects are the preferred food resource for these insects.  To assess the impacts of food resources on performance, we reared ladybeetles in the laboratory on several separate diets, tracking a suite of performance metrics.  Adult and larval ladybeetle longevity was greatest in mixed diet (scale insects and pollen) and scale insect treatments.  Additionally, adult female ladybeetles produced the greatest number of eggs in all diets containing scale insects.

However, over the past 20 years, molecular phylogenetic analyses have resulted in a reassessment of the taxonomy and species boundaries of this group, particularly in the shallow water zooxanthellate genera Zoanthus (family Zoanthidae) and Palythoa (family Sphenopidae). Such previous research has often focused on areas in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, yet there are many regions with little to no molecular data, and few recent historical reports. One such area is the Red Sea, Zoantharia in this region have not been examined closely for almost 60 years. In this study, we examined over 340 specimens collected in 2013-4 from the eastern coast of the Red Sea along a latitudinal gradient from Gulf of Aqaba in the north to the central Red Sea region near Jeddah in the south. DNA was extracted and mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA (mt 16S rDNA), cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) were amplified. Survey results showed the presence of at least three suborder Macrocnemina species (Parazoanthus sp., Antipathozoanthus sp., Microzoanthus sp.), representing the first records for this suborder from the Red Sea, along with two to three morphological species each of Palythoa and Zoanthus.  Phylogenetic results were compared with previous species descriptions from the Red Sea.

Here we ask whether seabird foraging distributions can be used as a proxy for juvenile fish recruitment inside and outside of MPAs in southern California.  We investigated the foraging rates of five piscivorous seabirds inside and outside of three island and three coastal MPAs in southern California and integrated these data with estimates of juvenile fish abundance using data from diver surveys at the same sites. Additionally, we integrated these data with regional measures of oceanographic productivity (e.g., upwelling, sea surface temperature) and larval fish abundance.  Our studies have shown that seabird foraging rates and juvenile fish abundance respond to variability in regional upwelling and larval fish abundance, with localized effects influenced by coastal geographic features such as promontories that impact larval delivery to nearshore habitats.

We assessed the effects of recent cold winters, which promote reproduction, on the southern range limits of the acorn barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*, in Southwest England.  We found the recent cold winters have led to a range expansion of *S. balanoides*, however, the frequency of such cold winters, which are necessary for *S. balanoides* persistence in the area, has declined over the past 30 years.  Additionally, we examined the mechanism of the relationship between cold temperatures and reproduction by rearing brooding *S. balanoides* under multiple environmentally-relevant temperature treatments.  While there was no significant difference in larval development rate, we found that brooding individuals reared at cold temperatures had significantly greater reproductive mass than individuals reared at warm temperatures.  This mass difference is produced by a nearly six-fold increase in larval number.  This study demonstrated the importance of considering the role of rare events in controlling species? distributions, particularly when they oppose the overall trend of climate change.",Population Biology and Ecology,Dispersal and Recruitment,,,Yes

Investigations of the dynamics of nuisance green macroalgae have mostly emphasized post-recruitment processes such as herbivory. Water samples (2L) were collected and cultured monthly at Tiburon to estimate temporal variability in propagule supply and seasonally at four additional sites spanning the central San Francisco Bay to determine spatial variability. Sterile resin settling plates (n=10) were simultaneously installed for 4-week periods along intertidal areas near Tiburon to estimate natural recruitment. Water collected from July 2014-July 2015 produced *Ulva* when cultured, with samples collected in spring and summer months yielding greater numbers of recruits/cm^2; indicating increased propagule supply at this time of year.  Although all sites yielded recruits, sites north of the bay mouth yielded more *Ulva* recruits than southern sites. Late summer 2014 recruitment peaks appear to coincide with decreases in propagule supply but may be explained by spring increases in propagule supply.",Dispersal and Recruitment,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

While some work has been done examining biotic habitat complexity in marine systems, little work has been done examining the impact of epiphytes in adding complexity, and therefore, increasing epifaunal community diversity. This study investigates the effect of Smithora naiadum, an epiphyte of Phyllospadix spp., on epifaunal communities found within the Northeast Pacific. Overall, community diversity metrics were found to increase with increasing S. naiadum cover (i.e. habitat complexity). However, community data showed no significant effect of habitat complexity on epifaunal community composition. Instead, epifaunal communities were significantly driven by site, suggesting the influence of other environmental parameters in driving epifaunal community structure in the study system.

Improved mapping of this zone has been repeatedly identified as a critical data need, yet the costs associated with empirical mapping are currently prohibitive. Here we demonstrate a practical approach to filling the white zone using existing seafloor and shoreline mapping data and mathematical interpolation techniques to develop predictive maps of substrate characteristics in the white zone.  To determine an optimal interpolation method, we used geographic information systems software (ArcGIS) to create artificial white zones within the substrate maps, and tested ten interpolation techniques, crossed by five resampled pixel sizes, crossed by four artificial white zone widths, to determine which combination generated the most accurate and precise prediction of rock versus sand substrate across a variety of white zone widths. We then applied the methods with the highest precision and accuracy to generate predictive substrate maps of rock versus soft bottom within the white zone of the North Central Coast.

Chemical and other cues from predators can change prey behavior and potentially reduce foraging rates, however, novel introduced predators may not be recognized by native prey.  Recognition of predator cues may be influenced by climate driven changes in air or water temperature affecting consumer metabolism and foraging rates. However, little is known about how non-consumptive impacts may interact with climate change.  We examined how the foraging rate of an intertidal whelk (*Acanthinucella spirata*) on barnacles (*Balanus glandula*) changes in the presence of native crabs (*Romaleon antennarium*) or non-native crabs (*Carcinus maenas*) in Tomales Bay, California.  We also examined how *A. spirata* weight changed in the presence of the two crab species.  We found that native crabs significantly reduced weight gain in *A. spirata*, whereas non-native crabs had no effect. Moreover, we found that *A. spirata* grew significantly faster in warmer waters, independent of predator presence.  However, we found little effect of either predator on barnacle consumption rates.

Although the morphology of the triangular baleen plates has been described in many species, these measurements have been limited to two dimensions. We used computed tomography (CT) to estimate the three-dimensional volume available for flow in baleen samples from two different species, fin whales (*Balaenoptera physalus*) and sei whales (*Balaenoptera borealis*). Using the CT images, we measured the space between the plates available for flow and estimated the total three-dimensional flow volume. Preliminary results indicate that the total flow volume in a section of fin whale baleen was an order of magnitude greater than that for the same number of plates of sei whale baleen. This is likely due to the animals' relative size as well as their preferred prey: sei whales feed primarily on copepods, while the larger fin whales feed on larger items such as schooling fish and krill. Understanding baleen's 3D geometry may provide insight on pressure changes and flow speeds during filtration, ultimately enabling us to elucidate the hydrodynamic mechanisms driving baleen filtration.",,,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

I recorded the days it took to see the first sporophyte in each dish and a week later counted the number of sporophytes, female gametophytes, and eggs to standardize the data among replicates. I found that when comparing the density between selfed and outcrossed recruits there was a reduced number of recruits in selfed than in outcrossed cultures at both sites; the effect was not site specific. I also found that recruitment was delayed in selfed cultures, but the severity of the delay varied between sites.

Our results document a remarkably diverse juvenile diet and an important ecological role for tiny gastropod and bivalve prey.  Early survival was surprisingly high during the first 6 months, but then declined, perhaps as preferred prey were depleted and juvenile stars became more vulnerable to bird predation.  Juvenile *Pisaster* experienced a trend of increasing, and then decreasing, incidence of SSWD, and this cycle was temporally delayed relative to that of adult *Pisaster*.

A relationship between reproductive output and recruitment is often difficult to detect for many species, and the underlying factors affecting the relationship are often poorly explored.  In this study, we investigated whether reproductive output and subsequent recruitment were correlated in a model intertidal crustacean species, the Flat Porcelain crab (*Petrolisthes cinctipes*), and which factors may affect this relationship.  We recorded reproductive output, recruitment and relevant biological and physical factors at nine sites spanning 900 km of the Northern California coastline. Total reproductive output and total recruitment were positively correlated: sites with greater reproductive output had greater recruitment. Habitat composition was the primary factor related to both total reproduction and recruitment. In addition, habitat aspect was related to the density of recruits; more recruits were delivered to sites that faced into the prevailing swell. Thus, habitat characteristics appeared to be an important driver of the relationship between reproductive output and recruitment of Petrolisthes cinctipes populations. Habitat composition and aspect are easily measured and could be inexpensive indicators of reproductive output and recruitment for managing metapopulations of other intertidal species.",Dispersal and Recruitment,Population Biology and Ecology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Previous laboratory experiments have indicated variable effects of pH stress on allocation to growth and calcified structures in marine organisms that could influence predator-prey interactions. However, our understanding of potential OA impacts on species interactions in nature is limited. To begin to assess the potential effects of OA on predator-prey interactions in nature we examined body size and condition of a keystone predator (*Pisaster ochraceous*) and its molluscan prey (*Mytilus californianus*, *Chlorostoma funebralis*) across nine intertidal sites in northern California that vary in their exposure to low-pH conditions. Preliminary results indicate that *Pisaster* and *Mytilus* are larger with better condition in low upwelling sites, but that *Chlorostoma* size and condition is invariant across sites. Predator and prey body size and condition are also strongly positively associated within high upwelling sites, but strongly negatively associated (*Chlorostoma*) or not associated (*Mytilus*) at low upwelling sites. Supporting previous findings, our results suggest predator-prey interactions may vary with upwelling. However, because upwelling drives other key factors (e.g., productivity, recruitment, predator-prey abundance) that may be driving our patterns, the independent effects of pH must be isolated in future studies.",,,No,,No

Our objectives were to quantify natural variation in FE, and test the hypothesis that birds 'warm up' during morning singing. We found significant variation in FE among individuals and song-types. FE consistently increased during the early morning, suggesting that males warm up over the course of the morning. Furthermore, FE decreased with latency since the last song rendition. These findings potentially explain the prevalence of the dawn chorus in songbirds as well as high singing rates, because birds need to start singing early to reach high performance levels and sing often to sustain high performance levels.

We observed strong differences in communities among habitat types and CAU sites. Consumer exclusion on CAUs increased invertebrate densities overall, though this effect was highly site-specific. Maximum densities (approximately 2000/m^2) and community structure were generally similar between the two methods; however, the methods differed in their effectiveness at evaluating specific taxa.

Our study used the fouling communities of northern and southern California to study the prevalence of an invasive bryozoan, *Watersipora subtorquata*, and whether its effects on community structure and diversity differ regionally. Results showed greater variation in both *Watersipora* cover and Shannon Diversity within regions-Long Beach, CA and Bodega, CA-than among them, highlighting the potential for greater fine-scale environmental variation. Non-natural substrates (e.g. cement, plastic) had greater *Watersipora* cover and Shannon Diversity than natural substrates (e.g. rock), though these effects did not differ significantly between regions. Multivariate analyses revealed that community structure among regions differed significantly at different levels of *Watersipora* cover. These surveys serve to inform later field experiments that will test *Watersipora*?s community influence as a foundation species. Studies of invasion ecology provide a unique opportunity to understand the forces ultimately driving community structure.",,,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Fish surveys conducted by DAR (Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources) have shown that when yellow tang populations decrease due to fishing pressure, there is as an increase in lavender tangs Acanthurus nigrofuscus, perhaps in response to a reduction in competition between these two species. Based on this pattern, it would appear that yellow tangs are dominant over lavender tangs. To test this hypothesis we compared fish surveys completed between 2013-15 to examine how these patterns change with depth. In addition,  we analyzed videos taken of these two species to quantify the  nature and extent of aggressive interactions.

These conditions elicit negative physiological responses in calcareous organisms throughout their complex life histories. Evaluating the differential impacts of elevated pCO2 and temperature throughout ontogeny is critical for understanding how climate change will affect population dynamics of marine organisms. Early life stages are of particular interest because they serve as population bottlenecks due to their susceptibility to environmental conditions. The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) is a globally distributed, habitat-forming species with a complex life history, yet minimal information exists concerning its responses to imminent changes. Here, we synthesize results from several experiments testing physiological responses of multiple M. pyrifera life history stages to elevated pCO2 and temperature. Specifically, elevated pCO2 and temperature antagonistically affect zoospore settlement, while increased pCO2 facilitates gametophyte survival and sporophyte production. Additionally, elevated pCO2 and temperature synergistically improve photosynthetic performance and growth in juvenile and adult sporophytes.

Here we explore the relationships between habitat structure and fish population density and biomass across a seascape that is naturally fragmented.  Multibeam sonar and GIS analysis were employed to create a seascape map that explicitly depicts bathymetry and spatial configuration of kelp-forest rocky reefs in southern California.  Georeferenced subtidal surveys were conducted across this seascape to describe fish and macroalgae communities.  Algae, bathymetric, and configuration metrics represent a range of habitat structure types used in our analysis. These metrics were used to explain how the density, biomass, average size, and maximum size of five kelp forest fish species varied with habitat structure. The configuration of surrounding habitat was significantly more important in explaining the fish populations compared with algae or bathymetric variables.  Furthermore, species exhibited individualized responses to these metrics.

A persistent challenge is to distinguish the effects of climate change from other forms of environmental variation and to understand how environmental variation impacts accretion-erosion processes across different spatial scales. In this study, we used natural gradients to test how secondary calcification and bioerosion rates respond to environmental variability across small (32m) and large (2000km) spatial scales. Highly accurate bioerosion and secondary calcification rates were calculated from micrometer-scale 3D images of CaCOsub(3) blocks from year-long deployments at 30 reefs across Hawaii. We correlated these rates with a suite of co-measured chemical, biological, and physical data sets assembled from monitoring and remote sensing data and determined the strongest drivers of accretion and erosion at each spatial scale. There are three major outcomes from this study: 1) the bulk of the variability in accretion-erosion rates were at the smallest within-reef spatial scale, 2) accretion and erosion rates were driven by different parameters and 3) the strongest correlates of accretion and erosion differed across spatial scales. This data set highlights the significance of spatial scale in understanding reef dynamics and, further, the need to recognize both reef accretion and erosion processes in order to predict net coral reef response to future environmental change",Ecosystem Assessment,Special Topic: Long-term Monitoring for Long term Change,,,Yes

Complete mitochondrial genomes were recently determined for representatives of two Eastern Pacific genera that are normally included in Lepidochitonidae, *Nuttallina and Cyanoplax*, and both were found to share a derived inversion of a seven-gene cluster of tRNA genes relative to other chitons and even other mollusks. Using the available chiton mitochondrial genomes, we designed PCR primers used in combinations of three or four to test whether members of selected other chiton genera, including Lepidochitona (the type genus of Lepidochitonidae), share this derived inversion found in *Nuttallina* and *Cyanoplax*. The tests should produce distinctive gel banding patterns for inverted versus normal mitochondrial genome regions. If *Lepidochitona* shares this derived inversion for the seven-gene portion of their mitochondrial gene order, this is evidence supporting the monophyly of Lepidochitonidae.

In the Caribbean, the coral *Porites astreoides* occurs as a brown and green morphotype, which are both colonized by burrowing invertebrates, yet shed sediment at different rates. As the ability to shed sediments is likely to alter the ease with which invertebrate larvae settle on coral colonies, we tested the hypothesis that burrowing invertebrates would be differentially distributed between color morphotypes of *P. astreoides*. Working on shallow reefs in St. John, US Virgin Islands (~6m depth), colonies of *P. astreoides* (n=380) were surveyed for color, the presence and density of burrowing invertebrates, and size of the colony (as the potential for burrowers to inhabit a coral increases with size of the colony). A three-way contingency table revealed that more green colonies than brown colonies harbored burrowing invertebrates (48% vs. 21% respectively) across all size classes, and a two-way ANOVA showed that the density of burrowers (no/cm^2) was 29% greater on green than on brown morphotypes.

However, in other systems, predators have also been shown to sublethally affect herbivores, including behavioural alterations, with resulting effects on primary producers. Field surveys in northern New Zealand showed that predators and kelp were more abundant, and sea urchins less abundant, inside two marine reserves compared to adjacent fished reefs. However, inside reserves sea urchins were highly cryptic (sheltering in crevices to larger sizes) and had thicker, stronger tests than those on fished reefs. We hypothesised that these behavioural and morphological patterns observed could be due to a direct response to increased predation risk and/or indirectly related to greater kelp availability in reserves. We ran experiments to distinguish between these possibilities. The experiments revealed that cryptic behaviour was induced by predation cues (injured conspecifics) regardless of food availability, while more robust tests resulted from increased food supply regardless of predation cues. These findings suggest that the trophic cascade reported in this system is likely strengthened by predation cues forcing surviving urchins into crevices, restricting their grazing on live kelp. The greater supply of drift kelp in marine reserves, an indirect predator effect, enables sea urchins to build stronger tests, which may in turn help them resist predators.",Community Ecology,Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Ambiguity surrounding frequency of multiple brooding complicates fisheries management. The production of multiple broods, especially if influenced by maternal size or age, adds further uncertainty to accurate estimation of annual fecundity. Although stock assessments typically account for size- or age- dependent fecundity when data are available, no assessments have yet formally addressed the issue of multiple-spawning, which could be another mechanism for size- or age- dependent fecundity if it occurs more frequently in larger, older individuals. Identification of multiple brooding, and determination of the proportion of occurrence, is essential for accurate projections of spawning output. We use three methods to identify multiple broods: macroscopic ovary examination, fresh microscopic inspection and histological analysis.

For the common octocoral *Gorgonia ventalina*, Aspergillosis is a well-known disease that can lead to widespread mortality.  We evaluated the impacts of Aspergillosis on the population growth of *G. ventalina* on shallow reefs (9 m depth) at two sites on the south coast of St. John, US Virgin Islands.  Colonies of *G. ventalina* were censused for density, size, and presence of Aspergillosis in March and August 2015, and the results used to construct a life history table (pooled between sites) based on growth, mortality, and recruitment; fecundity was estimated from the literature.  A matrix model was used to evaluate population growth (i.e.,  ? ) under empirical Aspergillosis infection rates.  Although the sites were only 1.5 km apart, Aspergillosis infection rates differed between sites (24.3% versus 13.2%), and in 2015, densities of *G. ventalina* were 1.1 versus 2.1 colonies m^-2, respectively.  Preliminary results suggest that Aspergillosis infections have the potential to depress population growth of *G. ventalina*, and could play an important role in mediating the abundance of octocorals on present-day coral reefs.",Population Biology and Ecology,Physiological Ecology,Yes,Organismal/Population Biology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

We created a model tide pool simulation in order to determine how kelp, specifically *Pelvetiopsis limitata*, affects the pH of water over 5 hours, which approximates one tidal period. In the experimental tanks, the increase in pH showed that the presence of kelp affects the amount of CO2 at tide pool scales.

We measured absolute pupil size in ambient bright and dark conditions. We further measured pupil response to colored light (controlled for brightness) following periods of darkness. Color treatments were white (broadband), orange (630 nm), red (640 nm), or near-infrared (940 nm). We found a 47- to 78-fold increase in pupillary area between bright and dark conditions. This range is similar to shallow-diving marine mammals, but smaller than deeper divers. We detected constricted pupillary response to all colors except the near-infrared, supporting the claim that sea otters have more color sensitivity than other marine mammals.

This may affect larval survival, growth rates, and protection against drilling or crushing predators and/or physical stresses such as pounding wave action. Mussels often occur in abundant, multi-layered, complex physical structures that provide a foundation for diverse assemblages of species. We compared a variety of metrics associated with shell thickness in *Mytilus californianus* mussels originating from Pacific Northwest sites over the past two millennia. We analyzed mussel shell samples from modern (2000s), historical (1960s and 1970s) and archived Native American midden (1000 to 2420 ybp) sites. Large modern shells were thinner overall, thinner per age and thinner per length of mussel. Thus, these modern *M. californianus* shells are calcifying less than they had in the past. One hypothesis for the decreased thickness of modern California mussels is potentially decreased seawater pH and saturation state of seawater. If this decreasing shell thickness trend in *M. californianus* continues and affects its survival and/or abundance, its role as a foundational species could also negatively impact a diverse intertidal community of over 300 species of associated organisms.",Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,,,No

Additionally, we are measuring the photosynthetic carbon uptake potential and physiology of S. horneri and comparing these measurements to that of dominant native macroalgae. Our initial results suggest that S. horneri negatively impacts native algal biodiversity, but that S. horneri has higher photosynthetic efficiency and greater photosynthetic rates compared to native species.

In response to extracellular Hsub(2)Osub(2), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in these algae is cleaved to form the more potent antioxidants dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and acrylic acid. We hypothesized that increases in extracellular H2O2 would cause DMSP production to be upregulated in the intertidal algae *Ulva intestinalis*, *Ulva lactuca*, *Ulva linza*, and *Ulvaria obscura*.  To test this hypothesis, algae were exposed to 0, 5, 20 and 80 µM Hsub(2)Osub(2),  using two exposure treatments, a single 3-hour exposure and continuous exposures.

The greatest density of juvenile corals originally occupied the skeletons of the dead branching coral *Pocillopora* spp. however, survivorship of these corals was lower than on any other habitat. It is likely that this high mortality of corals on dead *Pocillopora* resulted from the rapid erosion of these structures during the same time period.

Organisms with skeletons made of high-magnesium (Mg) calcite could be especially vulnerable to OA given the elevated solubility of this form of calcification.  Mg content is known to vary in response to temperature, CaCOsub(3) saturation state, nutrients, and other factors.  However, it is unknown how multiple concurrent changes in these oceanographic conditions might interact to affect calcification and growth.  In a 6-month laboratory experiment, we cultured genetic clones of the bryozoan *Membranipora tuberculata* from the northern California coast under a factorial design with varying food, temperature, and dissolved COsub(2) levels.  Decreased food and warm temperatures (16 C, 21 C) simultaneously increased Mg concentrations in skeletal calcite, and this skeletal material was markedly more susceptible to dissolution compared to calcification added under cool temperatures (11 C) and high food availability.  High COsub(2) and cool temperatures also induced breakdowns in zooid function, while elevated food availability increased growth.  These results suggest that oceanographic factors interact synergistically to affect dissolution potential.

We examined the impact of fish stocking on communities and ecosystems in California mountain lakes across an elevational gradient to determine how trophic cascades and ecosystem function vary with climate.  We show that the impact of fish on the pelagic consumer to producer biomass ratio strengthened at low elevation, while their effect on invertebrate community composition was greatest at high elevation. The results suggest that species turnover reduces the strength of trophic cascades in cold lakes but not warm lakes. Benthic ecosystem rates (periphyton production and litter decomposition) were most influenced by predators at high elevation through top-down effects of fish on benthic invertebrates.

These hydro-chemical conditions create a stressful habitat for organisms, especially benthic infaunal communities. For benthic invertebrates, crustaceans are important to the food web and help control algal populations by grazing. Crustaceans are also known to be used as indicators of harsh environmental conditions. In 2009, hydrographic structures were implemented adjacent to culverts at the pond to increase water flow and ultimately improve water conditions. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen data was collected using YSI sondes. Benthic infaunal samples were collected and identified before, by Oliver et al. 2009, and after, by Christine Mann, the installment of the water control structures. All crustaceans were counted and identified to lowest taxonomic level. Three species of amphipods were found in higher abundance compared to the Oliver study, but no tanaidaceans, sea spiders, or crabs were found. These results show an increase in abundance of some species, especially an invasive amphipod, *Monocorophium insidiosum*, but a drop in diversity of the benthic crustacean community. This suggests the habitat may still be struggling to maintain a healthy ecosystem with climate change and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.",,,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

A recent literature meta-analysis showed general increasing wind trends in three of the five EBCS worldwide and also that the degree of wind intensification was stronger with increased latitude.  This is consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change and could lead to higher biological productivity.  Since 2014, 'The Blob' has been a dominant feature of the NE Pacific, warming the environment as much as 3-4°C above average.  Here we show that upwelling-favorable winds and cooling ameliorated Blob-related warming in the coastal zone of the California Current Ecosystem until the fall of 2014.  However, after upwelling subsided in the fall, warming led to significant ecological impacts such as seabird and marine mammal mortality events, suggesting severe food shortages.

We exposed eggs, sperm, or both to environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA or styrene to test that exposure would lead to developmental abnormalities. While fertilization was not affected by exposure, time to first cleavage was faster in exposed vs. unexposed gametes (eggs: 16.92 ± 5.62 minutes; sperm: 9.13 ± 2.24 minutes; both: 18.06 ± 6.27 minutes).

Dissolved oxygen (DO) regularly declines to levels known to be physiologically stressful for marine fauna, with the potential to affect the overall health of resident taxa, such as rockfish of the genus *Sebastes*. Due to their abundance across nearshore habitats, rockfish are ecologically important and a significant resource to fisheries?thus, understanding how these animals respond to reoccurring hypoxic conditions is critical. A majority of species physically responds to low DO via behavioral and/or physiological modifications, but specific thresholds and sublethal effects of hypoxic stress within most taxa are relatively unknown. To investigate how hypoxic events physiologically affect rockfish, we treated young-of-year (YOY) *Sebastes* (*S. mystinus*, *S. paucispinus*, *S. goodei*, *S. serranoides*) to an acute hypoxic exposure that simulated [DO] under a natural upwelling event. We then examined several physiological metrics, including analysis of enzyme markers that provide insights into tissue-level metabolism and blood biochemical indicators to test for systemic stress. Overall, our results show that YOY rockfishes have species-specific physiological responses to hypoxia, which in turn may influence a diverse set of factors spanning from growth to predator-prey relationships and, ultimately, to fitness.",,,No,,No

To evaluate how predator and prey distributions might change, we used a space-for-time comparison across a latitudinal gradient that encompasses greater temperature variation than the warming anticipated over the next century. Intertidal surveys were conducted at 0.5-m vertical intervals along 5 transects at 20 sites spanning the Gulf of Maine. We hypothesized that predators would be distributed lower in the intertidal at lower latitudes (due to higher thermal stress) and that prey abundance would be inversely related to predator abundance. These hypotheses were supported: there were strong interactive effects between latitude and tide height for predator and prey species, which were more abundant higher in the intertidal in northern latitudes that southern latitudes, and prey abundance was inversely related to predator abundance. Importantly, there was a predator x latitude interaction suggesting that impacts of predators change across spatial gradients and will shift over time in the future.",,,No,,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

To test whether this relationship holds in individual juvenile purple sea urchins, we divided 90 animals into two treatments for six months. In the high food treatment, urchins had constant access to kelp. In the starvation treatment, urchins were given kelp every 12-14 days for 24 hours.

Test diameter and body size corrected gonad weight were significantly lower for starved animals than for those with constant food, but their ratio of jaw length to test diameter was significantly higher. Treatments were then switched for the remaining animals.  It is predicted that relative jaw length is reversibly plastic and will therefore decrease after starved animals are held in high food conditions.

In coastal marine systems, water flow is a major source of environmental variation that constrains biological processes and shapes community structure, yet its role in mediating diversity effects is poorly understood. We investigated how water flow interacts with diversity to determine community filtration. We conducted a series of laboratory filtration experiments in which we manipulated water flow rates and suspension feeder diversity and measured clearance rates of cultured phytoplankton. In some cases, competition among species inhibited filtration, while in others filtration by combinations of suspension feeders exceeded filtration by the constituent species in isolation. These contrasting results can partly be explained by morphology (erect vs. prostrate growth forms) and differential responses to water flow. While water flow typically reduced filtration, some communities with multiple growth forms filtered more under flow even when constituent species underperformed. Our results demonstrate that water flow variation can influence community filtration by allowing expression of trait differences and by modifying species interactions, supporting the view that diversity helps maintain functioning in naturally variable environments.",Community Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Foundation species may suffer increased grazing pressure following changes in the population sizes or foraging behaviors of grazers.  Early life stages are particularly vulnerable and local recruitment bottlenecks may occur if high grazing rates are sustained.  However, both coral reefs and oak woodlands illustrate incredible resiliency to grazing: Following heavy losses, coral can regrow from remaining fragments, while oaks can send up additional shoots.  This ability to regenerate poses a challenge to demographers because it decouples the size ? age relationship and reduces the accuracy of age estimation.  Fortunately, protection from grazing has been shown to allow both corals and oaks to outgrow grazing damage, thereby facilitating maturity to reproductive size.  Notably, the size refuge of oaks and other palatable trees was consistent (at maximum reach of deer), whereas the size refuges of corals varied considerably by morphology.",Applied Ecology,Special Topic: Long-term Monitoring for Long term Change,,,Yes

Fishing selectively removes older, larger fish, truncating the size distribution. Inside an MPA, the population should begin to 'fill in' this distribution as fish survive longer and grow larger. However, this effect can be difficult to detect. Drawing on ecological theory, we developed a new approach to quantify the rate of filling in. This consists of using an integral projection model to estimate the unfished size distribution of a population, then calculating the vector angle of deviation between the current size distribution and the unfished distribution. A decreasing trend in that angle of deviation over time indicates filling in. We applied this method to data on kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus) and California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher) populations inside MPAs in the northern Channel Islands. For these species, trends of overall fish abundance within individual MPAs were generally positive but highly variable. Nonetheless, most MPAs showed a consistent trend of convergence on the unfished size distribution, while most fished sites did not exhibit convergence. This method provides a new statistic to describe the effects of MPAs on old, large fish.",Special Topic: Evaluating Protected Areas,Fisheries Ecology,,,No

Shifts in factors limiting individual fitness can occur with changes in availability of resources, and the perceived value of a particular habitat depends not only on self, but also on other options in the choice. Coral reefs around the world have experienced accelerated reef degradation symbolized, in many cases, by dramatic shifts from coral dominance to fleshy macroalgae. Here, we explore reef fish habitat associations at 9 sites across the coasts of Rapa Nui, where large and persistent among-site variability in dominance of coral or macroalgae at similar depths can be found. Field surveys document generally similar reef fish composition, with all commonly occurring species presenting strong habitat electivity.  Only two species showed consistent elections across all sites, regardless of local benthic community structure, suggesting perceived value was an intrinsic habitat property. All others showed plastic responses with differences in habitat election depending on contrasting community configuration. Where corals dominate, individuals preferentially used macroalgae that naturally rare on the landscape.  In contrast, macroalgae were generally avoided where common, with Labrids and Chaetodontids consistently utilizing different alternative habitat types.",Behavioral Ecology,Species-Habitat Associations,,,Yes

Predictability of aggregations in both time and space allows for plentiful yield with relatively low fishing effort. However, this places certain species at risk of overharvest. The Barred Sand Bass (*Paralabrax nebulifer*) off California has been exhibiting the characteristics of an aggregation-based fishery that is on the verge of collapse, as annual catch estimates have shown a greater than 90% decrease in 10 years. Population declines of aggregation-based fisheries have a tendency of going unnoticed, as fishery-dependent stock assessments do not generally account for spatio-temporal variability. This study aims to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of Barred Sand Bass spawning aggregations at Huntington Flats, California. Transect surveys were conducted using split-beam SONAR to examine spatial variability in relation to environmental factors (e.g., temperature, thermocline, lunar phase). The objective was to identify factors that would aid in the predictability of aggregating behaviors. Spawning aggregations occurred over shallower depths during new moon events compared to full moon events. This is possibly due to variations in tidal current, as these aggregations occur midwater.

In coastal marine ecosystems, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can reestablish depleted predatory fish populations. The resulting increase in predation pressure may result in changes to community structure or function. To test whether prey mortality is elevated inside MPAs, 6 experimental dive locations were selected along the central California coast, 3 inside and 3 outside of MPAs. At each location, divers conducted benthic surveys and tethering experiments, using a species of Caridean shrimp (Pandalus danae) and Brachyuran crab (Pugettia richii). Predatory fishes of invertebrates were more abundant inside MPAs, while prey densities and habitat structure were similar between MPAs and their adjacent reference sites. Relative mortality rates for both P. richii and P. danae were significantly higher at all sites inside MPAs compared to sites outside, except for Stillwater Cove, where fish densities are similar to the adjacent reserve. Spatial differences in prey mortality were also related to predator identity, which varied from the Carmel- to Monterey-side of the peninsula. The results of this study provide strong evidence that increased densities of predatory fishes inside MPAs increases predation pressure on benthic crustaceans.

As fishes grow from small recruits to larger juveniles, the effect of seagrass structural complexity on their interactions with the environment and in turn their habitat preferences, survival, and growth may change dramatically. We conducted a lab experiment, visual surveys and two field experiments to determine if the effects of eelgrass (Zostera marina) structural complexity on juvenile giant kelpfish (Heterostichus rostratus) habitat preference, survival and growth varied with fish body size. Our mesocosm experiments show clear shifts in habitat preference, with an inverse relationship between fish body size and structural complexity; field surveys support these trends. Our predation risk experiment indicates that all size classes experienced higher predation risk in low structural complexity. Preliminary results from our ongoing growth experiment suggest that high and low structural complexity enhance proportional growth in smaller and larger fish, respectively. These findings demonstrate that high structural complexity may be most optimal for new recruits while low structural complexity may confer a predation risk-growth trade-off for older juveniles. Optimal nursery habitat use throughout ontogeny may be contingent upon small-scale changes in structural complexity.",Species-Habitat Associations,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge

Wave action affects the biological mechanisms of both clines, and consequently the lower boundaries fall at progressively higher shore levels from wave exposed to sheltered shores. We hypothesized that through the energetics of indeterminate growth, the contrasting long-term patterns of zonation incur markedly different initial growth rates, terminal sizes and hence population structures of the sea stars.  On wave-sheltered sites, sea stars should expend more energy foraging and have shorter feeding intervals than counterparts on wave exposed shores, and as a consequence the growth parameters should be lower. We confirmed this prediction by following the growth of individual sea stars uniquely tagged by a vital stain, and comparing the resulting size-dependent growth curves among shores with contrasting zonation. Since predation by this keystone predator is size- dependent, these findings bear implications for the dynamics of the *Mytilus-Pisaster* interaction.",Intertidal Ecology,Community Ecology,Yes,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,I am a student and am not eligible to judge
