"Abadía-Cardoso, Alicia",aabadia@uabc.edu.mx,UABC,"PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE SCIAENIDAE FAMILY FISHED IN THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA, MEXICO","The Gulf of California is recognized worldwide for its great biological diversity and productivity. Particularly, species of Sciaenidae Family, known as curvinas or croakers, represent an ecologically and economically important group of marine fish in the Gulf of California, including the Totoaba (*Totoaba macdonaldi*), whose fishery is among the most controversial in the world in recent years. Currently, there are no conclusive studies evaluating biological diversity and phylogenetic relationships among sciaenid species in the Gulf. In this work, I use molecular markers and analyzes to document the biodiversity of species of the Sciaenidae family that are fished in the Gulf of California, and define their genetic relationships. The analysis showed six phylogenetic groups: (a) *Umbrina roncador* and *Roncador sternsii*, b) *Totoaba macdonaldi*, c) *Micropogonias* (*M. altippinis, M. megalops, M. ectenes*), d) *Atractoscion nobilis*, e) *Cynoscion* (*C. othonopterus, C. xanthulus, C. reticulatus, C. parvippinis*) and *Isopisthus remifer*, and f) *Menticirrhus* (*M. undulatus* and *M. nasus*). These results are mostly consistent with those reported in previous studies, however, the species representing group e) did not show a separation between the two genus. In contrast, the individuals analyzed intercalate and show a high identity value. This study shows how genetic methods are necessary to document and understand biological diversity which translates in effective management strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Abadía-Cardoso, A.",UABC,,Yes,

Hawaiʻi is in a unique position to bridge this gap due to having the advantage of a dominant indigenous culture. There is a great potential to expand scientific understanding through indigenous methods that still remain dormant. Throughout Hawaiʻi, there has been a recent emergence of traditional ʻāina (land) based programs in science, conservation, reforestation and restoration. Through the University of Hawaiʻi, certain classes have also been tailored to the introduction and implication of these said indigenous methods. As we cultivate the implementation of indigenous sciences and practices alongside western systems, we can introduce a solution for the disconnect from traditional indigenous learning which can enhance modern scientific methodology as well as create a more efficient way of learning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,UH Mānoa,"Rodrigues, J.P",UH Mānoa,"Puniwai, N.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Akaka, K",UH Mānoa,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)

In tropical reefs echinoids feeding on macroalgae is avoid the phase shift phenomenon and favor to bioerosion high rates. The objective of this study was to observe changes of functional diversity of Echinoidea at Espiritu Santo Archipelago National Park from 2005 to 2017, using data from the official monitoring program of the marine protected area. To determine species richness and abundance, census of sea urchins were conducted in belt transects 30 x 2 m, and these data were combined with a series of 13 not correlated morphological traits of the 6 observed species, to define morphofunctional diversity at each transect. The results showed statistically significant differences for abundance, and functional richness, evenness and diversity in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in relation to 2006 and 2007, being lower in recent years. Although urchin abundance was higher in 2007. Also, the temporal trend obtained by a linear regression showed a decrease in the index. The pattern of sea urchin decrease has previously been detected in marine protected areas, and results from an increase in the biomass of predatory fish when regulation of fishing activities is implemented, and due to trophic cascade effects they regulate and decrease the echinoids community.

"Anderson, Kyra",kna169@humboldt.edu,Cal Poly San Luis Obispo,"PREDATOR IDENTITY, NOT PRIOR EXPOSURE HISTORY, AFFECTS TEGULA FUNEBRALIS ANTI-PREDATOR RESPONSE","Predators in the rocky intertidal can regulate prey behavior, which ultimately affects community structure. Although predators do not always consume prey, they can elicit non-consumptive effects (NCEs), as prey change behaviors to avoid predators, and allocate resources to defend against predation. By spending more time avoiding predators, prey spend less time foraging, which impacts basal resources, known as trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). Prey populations that experience greater predation pressure should have stronger NCEs and TMIIs, a hypothesis I tested with *Tegula funebralis*, which are known to respond behaviorally to their primary predators, including *Pisaster ochraceus*, *Romaleon antennarium*, and *Octopus rubescens*. I collected snails from four different populations (Belinda Point, Fort Bragg; Devil’s Gate, Cape Mendocino; Baker Beach, Trinidad; and Pt. St. George, Crescent City) which all vary in abundances of *Tegula’s* main predators. Over a 28-day experiment, I measured avoidance behavior, shell growth, and total growth to measure NCEs, and kelp consumption to measure TMIIs. I observed significant behavioral differences between treatments, however, I did not observe any significant growth differences between treatments. Finally, I observed a significant difference in kelp consumption among sites, with *Pisaster* cue treatment being the only treatment eliciting significantly lower feeding rates at all sites. Overall, I found that *Pisaster*, regardless of *Tegula* source population, are the only predator that induces NCEs and TMIIs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Anderson, K.A.",Humboldt State University and California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Cleaning symbiosis has many benefits for both client and cleaner. The Hawaiian cleaner wrasse, Labroides phthirophagus , is an endemic species with little known about their ecological roles compared to others obligate cleaners. Other studies showed they had preference towards some species, but these results were found in aquaria. Through various observations of what species being clean and running transects for sites abundance, we get to compare whether they have a preference. The results show that Hawaiian cleaner wrasse does have a preference on who they clean. Cleaning organisms have specialization on how and what is being cleaned.

The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) experienced a historically wet winter in 2017 when heavy rainfall reduced surface salinities drastically for several months, but the impact of this extended period of low salinity on organisms in the shallow subtidal region of the central bay is unknown. Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) is an important habitat-forming species worldwide, hosting a diverse community of epifaunal invertebrates. I conducted quarterly surveys in six SFE eelgrass beds beginning in July 2017 to quantify shoot density, epiphyte biomass, invertebrate community composition, sediment characteristics, and other factors. Following the low-salinity period, I observed large changes in the invertebrate community compared to pre-2017 data, including the disappearance of two key native species, Taylor’s sea hare (*Phylapllysia taylori*) and the isopod *Pentidotea resecata*. These ecologically important species feed on eelgrass epiphytes, increasing light availability to eelgrass and linking primary production to higher trophic levels. At the same time multiple invasive invertebrates became abundant. These findings reinforce a need to understand weather-related shifts in epifaunal community composition and distribution, as these may critically affect the conservation of critical foundational habitats, especially as climate changes intensify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Ayala, G.S.",San Francisco State University,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology
"Barton, Emma",ebarto01@calpoly.edu,Cal Poly SLO,ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF PARROTFISH CORALLIVORY ACROSS THE GREATER CARIBBEAN,"Parrotfishes are important herbivores that indirectly facilitate coral recruitment and growth by grazing algae on coral reefs. However, some species of parrotfishes also prey on coral, which can cause partial to total mortality, and reduce growth and reproduction of corals. The ecological drivers of parrotfish corallivory and the degree to which parrotfish scale back the predation intensity on corals in response to changes in reef community composition remain poorly understood. The objective of this study is to compare the intensity of parrotfish predation on reef-building corals across a gradient of parrotfish biomass, algae cover and coral cover on reefs in St. Croix and Bonaire. At each site, we surveyed: (1) parrotfish biomass and species composition, (2) the abundance and size distribution of bite scars on coral colonies in relation to coral species and size, and (3) percent cover of coral, algae and other food items targeted by parrotfish. We used a linear mixed effects model to compare the intensity of parrotfish predation on corals in response to differences in parrotfish biomass, algae cover and coral cover. Additionally, we compared patterns of predation at the coral-species level. We found that the intensity of parrotfish corallivory varied regionally and with a number of local factors. This analysis improves our understanding of how changes in coral reef community composition on increasingly impacted reefs alters the intensity of parrotfish corallivory, as well as species-specific differences in corallivory rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Cal Poly SLO,"Hale, T.C.",Cal Poly SLO,"Rempel, H.S.",Cal Poly SLO,"Ruttenberg, B.I.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Barton, E.M.",Cal Poly SLO,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)

In the Gulf of Alaska, Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*) deposit adhesive eggs on a variety of marine vegetation during their spring spawn, where the fertilized roe develops until hatching. Many photosynthesizing species used as spawn substrates can modify the pH of their boundary layer environments during local drawdown of inorganic carbon. The goal of this experiment was to investigate whether a photosynthesizing spawn substrate can mitigate the effects of elevated pCO~2~ and temperature on embryonic development and condition of newly hatched Pacific herring. We raised roe on either *Macrocystis pyrifera* blades or silicone strips under a factorial cross of current spring temperature and pH (pH 7.8, 7℃) and projected end-of-century (pH 7.5, 11℃) conditions in Sitka Sound, AK. Preliminary results indicate that effects of temperature are more pronounced than pH, with warmer temperatures increasing egg respiration and negatively affecting the nutritional status of larvae at hatch. Eggs fertilized on giant kelp blades experienced significantly lower fertilization success than eggs on non-photosynthesizing silicone; however, further assessment of substrate effects were complicated by poor retention of eggs on the blades.

These signals converge in form– the vocalizations of each species acoustically resemble sounds of their own dive displays. The vocal signals are produced as a static display in which the male does not move with respect to the female, whereas the dive display signals are produced when the male's dive velocity causes a Doppler shift in frequency by up to 8%. Since the male does not hear the effect of the Doppler shift, the sound that they produce is perceived differently by the recipients than by the male transmitters. I compare temporal and frequency characteristics between recorded dives, and songs characterizing the degree of temporal and frequency correspondence between these sounds to determine whether or not the male vocalizations suggest or mimic the Doppler shifted version of his dive sound.

These changes may have profound effects on seagrasses due their narrow thermal tolerances and carbon limitation. We tested how elevated temperature and carbon dioxide affect (1) the growth of eelgrass (*Zostera marina*), (2) the growth of epiphytic algae that competes with eelgrass, and (3) the ability a crustacean herbivore (the grass shrimp *Hippolyte californiensis*) to graze on epiphytic algae. We factorially varied temperature (ambient vs. elevated), CO2 (ambient vs. elevated, based on IPCC predictions), and the presence of grass shrimp in laboratory mesocosms. Trends across all of the trials show that elevated CO2 increased epiphyte growth, while elevated temperature decreased eelgrass growth. We did not find a negative correlation between epiphyte growth and eelgrass growth. Grazing impact by *H. californiensis* was driven by the combination of increased temperature and elevated CO2 levels. Increased temperature appears to lower grazing rates compared to ambient temperature conditions, but the negative effect of elevated temperature on grazing impact was lessened by elevated CO2 levels, suggesting that elevated CO2 may mitigate detrimental effects of warming water on herbivory. However, this effect was reduced under high ambient seawater temperatures, suggesting a temperature threshold for the system. Our results suggest that interactive effects of different stressors should be evaluated and that the impact of climate change on eelgrass communities may be complex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Dr.,"Hovel, K.A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Bergman, C.N",Ms.,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)

This increase in population resulted in the urbanization of watersheds. As the landscape of these watersheds changed, so too did the coastal ecosystems they fed. Analyses in one-sub watershed of Los Peñasquitos Lagoon through 1999 revealed that this anthropogenic input resulted in marine-associated habitats being replaced by those associated with freshwater. Our current work extends the spatial and temporal coverage of freshwater input and habitat change in the lagoon. Vegetation within the other two sub-watersheds was mapped from 1986-2018 using aerial images and historical data. This was then analyzed for change in relation to urbanization as determined from San Diego Association of Government Land Use mapping. A shift from saltwater-associated vegetation to freshwater-associated vegetation continues to suggest decreasing salinity in the upper lagoon, and this increased freshwater correlates with increasing urbanization within the watersheds. The change in this vegetation has the potential to impact the fauna within the lagoon and change how the ecosystem, as a whole, functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve,"Uyeda, K",San Diego Association of Governments,"Greer, K",Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve,"Crooks, J",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Bierzychudek, A.T.",,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

However, the ecological and evolutionary processes that contribute to variation in physiological plasticity are poorly understood. Here, we used the intertidal copepod *Tigriopus californicus* as a system for examining intraspecific variation in plasticity. Developmental plasticity in thermal tolerance among populations of *T. californicus* is negatively correlated with latitude across North America’s Pacific coast, increasing in southern populations that are adapted to warmer temperatures. By tracking thermal tolerance in different populations over time and rearing multiple generations under a common garden, we found evidence of *in situ* variation in the plasticity of thermal tolerance between northern and southern populations of *T. californicus* experiencing similar rates of seasonal warming. We measured additional traits associated with thermal physiology and found that sex-specific differences in mature body size and respiratory rate under temperature stress increased at higher latitudes. Our results suggest that distinct eco-evolutionary processes may differentially contribute to variation in thermal tolerance between southern and northern populations of *T. californicus*.

In addition, we found that, on average, starved urchins interact with the C. californica significantly less frequently, (P < 0.001) and are deterred from foraging significantly more (P < 0.01) than their fed counterparts.

Concerns about the potential impacts of microplastics, through chemical pollutant absorption, marine organism ingestion, and biomagnification indicate the importance of further investigation into the presence and types of microplastics in the Puget Sound.  An initial visual analysis used light microscopy to identify plastics and suggested their presence in sediment and surface water. An improved plastic extraction method and chemical analysis procedure was developed.  Samples were filtered through a series of sieves and vacuum filters followed by an adapted enzymatic digestion by proteinase-K in SDS, and density separated using zinc chloride prior to ATR FT-IR analysis. Spectra from these various locations were then analyzed to determine microplastic type. This filtration method paired with ATR FT-IR analysis is an efficient method that avoids plastic degradation and bias of manual sorting, and aids in the identification of microplastic polymers.

The project incorporates an experimental design in which eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) has been planted alone and either bayward or shoreward of native oyster substrate (reef balls topped with Pacific shell bags), which was shown in San Rafael to attenuate flow by up to 30%. The experiment also addresses whether the density of plantings affects success of eelgrass establishment. Oyster reefs were installed in April 2019, and eelgrass was planted in two periods in May and June 2019. A heat wave that occurred right after the second period led to high mortality of transplants from that period. Thus, early monitoring results show the importance of planting date over our other experimental manipulations on initial eelgrass establishment. Supplemental planting early in spring 2020 will re-create our planned treatments and permit evaluation of their effects over time, including on related functions and services such as fish and invertebrate habitat, ocean acidification, and carbon storage.

In this study, we investigated if kelp has a lower photochemical efficiency when directly interacting with Sargassum. We measured the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) on dark-acclimated tissue of both species via pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometry. Along benthic transect surveys, blades were collected from both species. We collected our samples from two sites that exhibited species interaction, and one site exhibiting complete cover by Sargassum. Our results indicated that Sargassum was significantly more abundant at the Intake Pipes site (ANOVA; p<0.01), and that kelp was significantly more abundant at the Chalk Cove site (ANOVA; p<0.02). At the Cherry Cove site, benthic cover was exclusively Sargassum. Photochemical efficiency remained high in both species (Fv/Fm: 0.767 +/- 0.008) when interacting but was significantly lower at the Sargassum exclusive site Cherry Cove (ANOVA; p<0.01) and associated with algal senescence. Therefore, Sargassum is not negatively affecting the photochemical efficiency of kelp at sites of interaction, and the longevity of Sargassum may be increased in the presence of kelp.

Crabs are highly vulnerable to sea otter predation, and Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) is an essential resource to fisheries and communities in Southeast Alaska. To date trophic linkages among sea otters, eelgrass communities and intermediate predators like crabs result in indirect positive effects on eelgrass mediated through sea otter predation on crabs. Through investigation of crab abundance along a sea otter gradient from 2017-2019, we find that crab abundance and size distribution decreases with increasing sea otter occupation. Larger crabs are completely absent in the presence of sea otters, but interestingly the diversity of crab species increases in the presence of sea otters. Our future studies will examine variation in recruitment as well as explore species interactions among crab species along this sea otter gradient. By developing a baseline of crab abundance and identifying size and abundance changes over time, we can further analyze the relationship between crabs and sea otters within this trophic cascade, with the ultimate goal to support  ecosystem based management that may account for the coexistence of sea otters and fisheries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Alaska-Fairbanks,"Domke, L.",University of Alaska-Fairbanks,"Raymond, W.W.",University of Alaska-Fairbanks,"Eckert, G.L.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Noel, B.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Waldschmidt, A.",,,,,,,,6,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",Cates R.J.,University of Alaska-Fairbanks,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Here, we assess the benthic succession of parrotfish bite scars across the reefs of Palmyra Atoll. We used a large-area imaging technique to create 3D models using Structure from Motion to virtually archive reef communities, and considered benthic change between September 2015 and September 2016. Across 4 200m2 reef plots, over 2000 parrotfish bite scars were identified and mapped onto the benthos so that the surrounding benthic cover could be identified to the nearest functional group. Mapped bite scars were re-identified in the subsequent time points, and the benthic composition of those areas were identified to functional group. Within the bite scars, crustose coralline algae (CCA) increased on average by 11.5% with a corresponding decrease in percent cover of turf algae. While coral recruits have been shown to prefer CCA as a settlement substrate, only one coral recruit was observed to settle on bite scar spaces across the duration of this study.

Current patterns in latitudinal ranges, demography, and vertical distributions of intertidal species can provide insight for future responses to climate change and sea level rise. In this study, we aimed to better understand population demographics and latitudinal shifts in vertical intertidal distribution of four predator species (*Nucella canaliculata*, *Nucella ostrina*, *Pisaster ochraceus*, and *Leptasterias spp.*) at 33 sites from central Oregon to Los Angeles County. We analyzed whether densities, mean and maximum sizes, size distributions, and vertical distributions varied by site and latitude in 2018. The densities of all four species were higher in Oregon than in California, which was driven by a high abundance of juveniles in three out of four of our species. This suggests that Oregon populations have higher rates of reproduction, may have higher survival rates, and thus may be more resilient to rapid changes than California populations.

Species distribution modeling using a machine learning approach provides novel tools for mapping areas of interest for restoration projects. Here we use stacked-species distribution models (s-SDMs) to identify candidate locations for installment of manmade reefs, a useful management tool for restoring structural habitat complexity and the associated biota in marine ecosystems. We created species distribution models for 21 species of commercial, recreational, ecological, or conservation importance within the Southern California Bight based on observations from long-term reef surveys combined with high resolution geospatial environmental data layers. We then combined the individual species models to create a stacked-species habitat suitability map, identifying over 800 km^2 of potential area for reef restoration within the Bight. Our results demonstrate that the existing manmade reefs included in our study on average are located in regions with habitat suitability that is not only less suitable than natural reefs, but also only slightly significantly better than random, demonstrating a need for more biologically informed placement of manmade reefs. The stacked-species distribution model provides insight for marine restoration projects in southern California specifically, but more generally this method can also be widely applied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA, USA","Claisse, J.T.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, CA, USA","Williams, C.M.","University of California, Riverside, CA, USA","Schwab, S.","Vantuna Research Group, Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Pondella, D.J.",,,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Zellmer, A.J.","Vantuna Research Group, Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA, USA",,No,

Encrusting bryozoans of the genus *Membranipora* are a common epiphyte throughout *M. pyrifera’s* range and form a crustose, opaque layer on kelp blades. Reduction of incident light by this layer may  negatively affect photosynthesis thus reducing primary production. This could have implications for kelp growth and surface water chemistry within kelp forests. Effects of bryozoan encrustation on primary production were measured using *in situ* growth surveys and photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) trials from June–August, 2019 in Monterey, CA. Tagged surface blades were measured weekly using a hole-punch method. P/R trials were conducted during the day and night with blades of varying levels of bryozoans inside sealed plastic bags with an oxygen probe. Growth surveys revealed that most blades were no longer growing by the time they were colonized by bryozoans, but encrusted blades showed a slightly higher decline in blade length. Unencrusted blades showed marginally significant higher rates of daytime O~2~ production (F~1,14~ = 4.78, p = 0.046). Recent studies have shown a positive correlation between warming ocean temperatures, recruitment of *Membranipora*, and deforestation of kelp beds. As the oceans continue to warm, outbreaks of this bryozoan could be detrimental to kelp forests and the ecosystem services they provide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State University, Northridge","Nickols, K.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Cohn, B.C.","California State University, Northridge",,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award)

Over the last 50 years, this distinct population has collapsed to less than 1% of its historic abundance, and a gap in our understanding of their population biology is likely limiting our ability to identify causes of decline. Longfin Smelt are believed to have a 2-year semelparous (single spawning) life history strategy; however, detailed studies of Longfin reproductive biology are limited. Determining maturation, batch fecundity, and lifetime fecundity is likely critical to understanding population dynamics and informing conservation. Here, we collected adult Longfin Smelt from South San Francisco Bay during the 2018-2019 winter spawning season and assessed gonad development (gonadosomatic index, GSI) and egg development (stage) as functions of length. Observations of GSI indicated that gonad development may occur in individuals at younger ages or smaller sizes than previously thought, and microscopy of eggs revealed instances of two distinct developmental stages of eggs within individual gonads. Earlier reproductive maturity and greater lifetime fecundity have implications for the population’s ability to rebound and thus remain important considerations for further studies to inform and enhance conservation efforts for this threatened species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Davis","Lewis, L.

Dispersal of larvae is influenced by environmental factors (e.g., climate oscillations, temperature, and currents) as well as biotic factors (e.g., pelagic larval duration time, feeding behavior, and swimming ability). Few studies have utilized long-term, spatially-explicit models to examine factors driving larval distributions across years. Yet developing predictive frameworks and integrating multiple stressors in a spatial context has been cited as an important area for future research. Spatial data in the form of larval fish catch data presents additional sources of sampling error, observation error, and spatial autocorrelation that can be difficult to account for in traditional analytical approaches. However, Bayesian methods can easily incorporate error and correct for autocorrelation while still providing estimates on actual parameter values that can be used for predicting larval abundances at a specific point in space and time. Here, we present preliminary results from a hierarchical, Eulerian-framed Bayesian model that combines long-term empirical CalCOFI catch data with environmental and biotic data to identify how larval distributions vary in space and time from southern Baja to southern California from 1951-2019.

This disease can cause atrophy of the foot muscle and digestive gland degeneration, which prevents nutrient absorption during feeding, causing the death of its host. The WS was first detected in black abalone, *Haliotis cracherodii*, populations in the Channel Islands, California, USA in the mid 80’s, and since has extended progressively to other populations along the coast of United States and Mexico. Withering Syndrome has caused mass mortalities of abalone, resulting in the collapse of the fisheries. In 1993, commercial and recreational black abalone fisheries were closed in California and, in 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service enlisted it in the Endangered Species Act. In recent years, a slow recovery of black abalone populations has been detected in both California and Baja California, however, these populations are still at risk of being affected by the WS, especially due to the stress caused by recent drastic environmental changes. For that reason, it is crucial to evaluate the occurrence of *C*Xc in some of the remaining populations in Baja California. On the other hand, the presence of a phage hyper parasite associated to the *C*Xc called Xenohaliotis phage (p*C*Xc) has been detected in recent years. This phage attacks the bacteria and reduces its pathogenicity.

Concerns about the potential impacts of microplastics, through chemical pollutant absorption, marine organism ingestion, and biomagnification indicate the importance of further investigation into the presence and types of microplastics in the Puget Sound.  An initial visual analysis used light microscopy to identify plastics and suggested their presence in sediment and surface water. An improved plastic extraction method and chemical analysis procedure was developed.  Samples were filtered through a series of sieves and vacuum filters followed by an adapted enzymatic digestion by proteinase-K in SDS, and density separated using zinc chloride prior to ATR FT-IR analysis. Spectra from these various locations were then analyzed to determine microplastic type. This filtration method paired with ATR FT-IR analysis is an efficient method that avoids plastic degradation and bias of manual sorting, and aids in the identification of microplastic polymers.

How salt marshes will respond depends on their ability to actively build elevation, which is determined by plant productivity and biomass. Yet, salt marsh productivity and biomass are not well-characterized across broad spatial scales or continuously in time. We combined seasonal field surveys and high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery from the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve to investigate the patterns and drivers of salt marsh biomass in the southern California region. We validated the UAV imagery using canopy reflectance captured in situ and found that UAV reflectance correlated highly (r2>0.86) to field measurements. UAV imagery was then used to test a suite of vegetation indices in their ability to predict aboveground biomass. NDVI provided the strongest correlation to aboveground biomass for each season, and when seasonal data were pooled (r2=0.44; rmse=451 g/m2). The NDVI aboveground biomass estimation model (AGB=2657.3*NDVI–59.1) was then used to create maps of biomass for each season. We found that spring exhibited higher average aboveground biomass (1150 g/m2) and total site-wide aboveground biomass in spring was estimated to be 192 Mg, approximately 50 Mg higher than all other seasons. Aboveground biomass peaks highest in spring at elevations ranging from 1.6 – 2.0 m NAVD88, and exhibits sharp declines at higher elevations, especially during summer.

Members of Acteonoidea have been traditionally classified based on morphological features, resulting in their original placement in Cephalaspidea because of the presence of a headshield. However, recent molecular studies have indicated that their morphology may be homoplastic and have reclassified Acteonoidea into a more basal group sister to Nudibranchia. Few detailed taxonomic studies have addressed the relationships between families and genera in this group. This study will build a molecular phylogeny based on a number of specimens from localities around the globe using two mitochondrial genes (16S and CO1) and one nuclear gene (H3). The goal of this analysis is to attempt to reconcile molecular and morphological data and determine the relationships among members of Acteonoidea. Specifically, it will examine whether Bullinidae is a valid family or is a member of Aplustridae. Preliminary data shows *Bullina* to be nested within Aplustridae and as a sister group to *Micromelo*. A second goal of this study is to determine whether *Micromelo undatus* is truly a circumtropical species or if there is undescribed cryptic diversity.

To examine this relationship, I grew five common species of red and brown intertidal macroalgae under elevated CO~2~ in laboratory mesocosms and observed them in feeding preference trials with two common intertidal grazers, the Northern kelp crab *Pugettia producta* and the black turban snail *Tegula funebralis*. Both grazers demonstrated a strong preference for brown algae, particularly *Egregia menziesii*, that were grown under elevated CO~2~, despite showing no preference among untreated algae. When offered an assemblage of conspecific algae exposed to a gradient of CO~2~ concentrations, *P. producta* exhibited preference for the treatment that yielded the greatest algal growth in each species (moderate exposure for *E. menziesii* and high exposure for *Laminaria setchellii*). These results suggest that choice is related to experimentally induced changes in algal biochemistry, and further work will examine nutritional and phenolic contents of treated algae to determine the mechanisms underlying the effects of CO~2~ exposure on algal palatability. Elucidating such pathways will lend further support to the findings from these laboratory preference trials, which indicate that ocean acidification has the potential to influence interactions between multiple intertidal grazers and macroalgae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Fieber, A.M.",Humboldt State University,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

How this increasing prevalence of disease is impacting coral restoration is still unknown. In addition, efforts to restore coral reefs through nursery outplanting are becoming increasingly common, necessitating information on where coral outplants would have the best chance at survival. We studied seven *Acropora cervicornis* outplants from four restoration sites around Little Cayman Island to better understand whether young corals grown in nursery settings were surviving once restored to the wild, and if spatial patterns in their survival were apparent. Presence of disease in the surrounding wild coral reef at these seven restoration sites was also assessed by transect and quadrat based surveys to document the prevalence and type of diseases present at the sites. We found that in spite of the pristine coastal reef ecosystem surrounding Little Cayman Island, outplanted *Acropora cervicornis* were more likely to thrive in deeper fore reef sites than shallower back reef areas. We hypothesize that this spatial pattern in survival among outplants results primarily because there is less algal competition at lower depths due to the lower concentrations of shore derived nutrients and sunlight penetration.  The diseases identified among nearby coral reef genera  provides a baseline for comparison with other reefs that are more heavily impacted by human activities to parse natural and direct human impacts on coral reef health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Gammie, S.A.",1) Humboldt State University 2) Central Caribbean Marine Institute,,,

Eastern Oysters are essential ecosystem engineers. Thus, efforts to restore Eastern Oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay serve to benefit the entire ecosystem as well as local fisheries and aquaculture. While aquaculture facilities often grow non-reproductive triploid oysters, some farms also grow diploid oysters, which produce gonad and hence can reproduce, in an effort to contribute to natural populations. The ability of diploid oysters grown in aquaculture to contribute to natural populations, however, may depend on their growing conditions. Eastern oysters change sex during their lifetime based on local environmental conditions. However, we have no knowledge of whether the method of growing oysters in aquaculture influences their growth and sex. In Maryland, oyster farmers grow oysters in cages that rest on the bottom of shallow estuaries or in surface floats that are suspended higher in the water column. This experiment aims to test whether the depth at which oysters are raised affects their sex ratios and growth. Using oysters collected from natural reefs and farms throughout Maryland, we found that oyster sex ratios were not affected by culture method; however, culture method affected how males and females grew and allocated energy, including toward reproduction. Considering culture method may, therefore, be a key component in predicting the potential of farmed oysters to contribute to natural populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Current address: Department of Biological Sciences: Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, Florida 33199 USA","Samara, Y.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Ogburn, M.B.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Breitburg, D.L.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Donelan, S.C.",,,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Gavriel, D.","Current address: Department of Biological Sciences: California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, California 90840 USA",,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)

To better understand coralline algal response to climate change projections, it is important to understand how they are already coping with seasonal fluctuations in seawater pH and temperatures. We investigated the natural seasonal growth rates of two morphologically different coralline algal groups from Sitka Sound, Southeast Alaska. In winter and summer of 2018, 76-80 coralline algal samples were collected from the field, stained with Calcein, and outplanted for 2-3 months at the same field site. Once recovered, specimens’ growth rates were quantified using fluorescence microscopy to image linear extension from stained meristematic tissue. In both seasons, the length extension of articulated coralline algae (x̅~W18~=0.18 ± 0.14 mm/month; x̅~S18~=0.22 ± 0.15 mm/month) was greater than that of crustose coralline algae (x̅~W18~=0.13 ± 0.06 mm/month; x̅~S18~=0.10 ± 0.09 mm/month). We estimate slightly more articulated coralline algal biomass added during summer (x̅=1.19 ± 0.04 mg/month) than winter (x̅=1.16 ± 0.04 mg/month), but we were unable to accurately estimate added biomass for crustose forms given our methods.

As an indicator of the production of chemical defenses total phenolic content (TPC) was used, and for physical defenses, foliar trichome density was used. To evaluate the induction of defense, two treatments were used: mechanical damage, and mechanical damage adding oral secretions of the herbivore *Lema daturaphila* (Coleoptera:Chrysomelidae). Considerable variation was found in both constitutive and induced defense in wild chili, which suggests genetic variability in relation to defensive traits.

We discuss our understanding of how primary producer density relates to the abundance of predators within an ecosystem, and whether trophic interactions are similar or different across varying scales and conditions as predator populations fluctuate. In this study, we used temporal and spatial trends of herbivore population dynamics and benthic community structure to evaluate a well-known trophic interaction between otters, urchins, and kelp in Southeast Alaska. We measured the probability of otter presence, sunflower star presence, kelp density, and urchin abundance and size structure at 14 sites in Sitka Sound, AK. We compared these data points to those collected using similar methods in 1988 (otters absent) and 2009 (otters present) by Estes et al. (1995). We found that an increased probability in otter presence contributed to a decrease in urchin populations and an increase in kelp observed over time (1988, 2009), and space (2018). Yet, the species assemblage has altered from 1988 to 2018. Our results imply that the ecosystem state in 2018 is departing from a ‘two-state’ view (i.e., sea urchin barrens in 1988, kelp forests in 2009, intermediate in 2018). While sea otters remain a crucial species in structuring kelp forest communities, we reevaluate our current understanding of the otter-urchin-kelp interaction and why it may vary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Santa Cruz,"Garcia, S.C.R.",UC Santa Cruz,"Langhans, M.R.",UC Santa Cruz,"Estes, J.A.",UC Santa Cruz,"Raimondi, P.T.",UC Santa Cruz,"Kroeker, K.J.",,,,,,,,6,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Gorra, T.R.",UC Santa Cruz,,,

Nutrient addition affects the health of corals directly, and also encourages the growth macroalgae which compete with corals for space and resources. Many coral reefs experiencing the effects of eutrophication are adjacent to islands with growing populations and expanding agricultural development. Mo’orea, French Polynesia, is an example of an island which has experienced large population growth and development in the past few decades. One result of this growth has been the conversion of forest to pineapple plantations in some of the island's major watersheds. To assess the effects of land use on coral reef ecosystems we created a time series of land cover change using remote sensing techniques to correspond with time series of coral cover, algal cover and dissolved nutrients collected in the field by the Mo’orea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) program. Our analysis found that reefs with high cover of macroalgae as detected by MCR LTER were located near the outlets of watersheds with significant agricultural development. Pairing in-situ readings of stream and reef health with land cover change satellite data will help us gain a better understanding of the effects of runoff on corals, and reveal the links between agricultural development on Pacific islands and the depletion of coral reefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of California Santa Barbara,"Underhill, W.J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Green, C.K.",University of California Santa Barbara,,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award)

While impacts of habitat loss and invasive species on seagrass communities are well-studied, few have considered their combined effects. However, these impacts often co-occur in urban estuaries, and it is unknown whether their effects on seagrass communities interact. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an experiment to assess the combined effects of seagrass habitat loss and invasive Asian mussels (*Arcuatula senhousia*) on infauna communities, as well as the potential for predators to modify *A. senhousia* impacts. We hypothesized that infauna diversity would be lowest in plots with both seagrass disturbance and *A. senhousia* presence due to synergistic effects of habitat loss and competition. We also hypothesized that predators would reduce *A. senhousia* impacts on infauna diversity. We factorially varied disturbance, mussel presence, and predator access in plots in Mission Bay, San Diego in summer 2019. Results to date suggest a trend for lowest diversity in plots with both seagrass loss and Asian mussels; however, diversity was only marginally lower than in plots with seagrass loss only, suggesting that effects of Asian mussels on diversity were limited. Also, diversity was higher in plots with predator access, suggesting that predator effects are stronger than effects of Asian mussel competition.

Placement of artificial nest boxes has contributed to increased nesting activity in urban areas, leading to Bluebirds using “foreign debris” (e.g. plastic) as nesting material, a phenomenon not well described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of foreign debris by nesting Western Bluebirds in areas of varying urban development, and measure potential impacts of this behavior on reproductive success. Fifty-seven nest boxes were deployed across areas of vary urbanization (i.e. low, medium, high) and monitored weekly for nesting activity, number of eggs, number and developmental stage of hatchlings, mortality, and foreign debris. At the end of the nesting season, we quantified and categorized all foreign nesting material. Of the nests analyzed to date, 90-100% included at least 1 piece of foreign debris regardless of urbanization level. Nests in areas with low urbanization had an average of 4.7 +/- 1.3 pieces of foreign debris, compared to 14.2 +/- 1.2 pieces and 18.4 +/- 1.6 pieces in areas with medium and high urbanization, respectively. Preliminary analysis also indicates foreign debris may negatively affect fledging success, but results will not be conclusive until all nesting is complete. As human interaction with songbird habitats continues, additional deleterious effects may be observed.

Many species that are native are also endemic. Hawaii ecosystems are venerable to invading species. Two invasive species including the red mangrove, (Rhizophora mangle) and the alga, (Gracilaria Salicornia) seem to be disrupting the habitat for the burrowing shrimp, (Alpheus rapax), and their mutualistic goby, (Psilogobius mainlandi). Although mangroves have been appreciated globally, they have caused problems for species in Hawaii by altering habitat features. Endemic species of Hawaii have not utilized the mangrove habitat. Shrimp/goby burrows appear to be abundant in sandy habitats. However, habitat utilization by the shrimp goby under the mangroves has not been evaluated. To determine if there was a difference in burrow density based on distance from mangroves, we compared burrow density by distance and then tested the effect of mangrove cover removal. There are significantly fewer burrows inside the mangrove area, and removal of mangrove cover resulted in increased burrow density.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",Mandy L.

While it is clear that diet varies significantly across the geographic range for opaleye, the mechanisms that drive these diet shifts are unknown. To better understand the consequences of diet shifts on opaleye physiology, we tested the hypothesis that diet affects metabolic performance in opaleye. We acclimated wild-caught juvenile opaleye to 20˚C and fed them one of three diets (herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous; consisting of Ulva and/or Artemia). We then used an intermittent flow respirometry system to measure maximum and standard metabolic rate (MMR, SMR), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and aerobic scope. Additionally, we measured growth. We found that diet had significant effects on metabolic performance and growth, with carnivorous diets displaying the highest growth, omnivorous diets conferring the highest SMR and intermediate growth, and herbivorous diets displaying the lowest SMR and no detectable growth.

Sandy beaches, characterized by low primary productivity, are dependent on marine-derived subsidies. Stranded patches of kelp, algae, and seagrasses, referred to as “wrack”, can support diverse invertebrate beach communities that rely on these resources for survival. These communities have been shown to utilize wrack patches differentially in response to a suite of morphological and physiochemical factors that ultimately influence species composition and abundance. To examine changes in beach invertebrate communities driven by the invasive alga, *Sargassum horneri*, wrack and invertebrate surveys were conducted in San Diego during the summer of 2019 and will be conducted again in the spring/summer of 2020. An experimental wrack deployment was also conducted in the summer of 2019 and will be repeated in 2020. Beach hoppers (*Megalorchestia* spp) are dominant wrack grazers and are therefore being treated as a focal group. Differences between communities found in wrack composed of the native *Macrocystis pyrifera* versus *S. horneri* may occur across southern California as the occurrence of *S. horneri* is expected to increase. Beach communities are already exposed to other anthropogenic stressors, resulting in multiple species experiencing regional declines and localized extirpations, further emphasizing the need to understand how *S. horneri* affects sandy beach systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Department of Biology and Coastal & Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Anderson, T.W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Harrison, L.N.","Department of Biology and Coastal & Marine Institute, San Diego State University",,,

In recent years, this fishery has been hampered by paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs); failed PST tests causes substantial economic loss to the geoduck fishery through increased sampling costs and by delaying or closing harvests. In the most recent commercial season, 25% of harvestable biomass was left in the ground due to PST closures. Clam toxicity within a harvest area varies substantially from week-to-week, fluctuating well above and below the regulatory limit. Geoduck clams (*Panopea generosa*) are filter feeders and can acquire PSTs by ingesting the toxin-producing phytoplankton, *Alexandrium* sp. Like many dinoflagellate species, *Alexandrium* alternates between a dormant, benthic stage, and a motile vegetative cell. The dormant cyst-stage persists in sediment during commercial clam harvests and we suspect they may influence wintertime toxicity in clams. To better understand the variation of geoduck toxicity, we are investigating spatial and temporal patterns of *Alexandrium* abundance through cyst-mapping. In collaboration with our partners, we collect sediments and clams and have counted high concentrations of cysts (>3000 cysts/cc sediment) in or near harvest areas with recent PST-related closures, as well as directly in the visceral mass of some clams. Uncovering these spatial and temporal patterns of cysts may provide valuable data to managers so that they may mitigate toxicity in commercial clams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,The Sitka Tribe of Alaska Environmental Research Lab,"Lanphier, K.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Shields, M.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Eckert, G.L.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Hart, C.E.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)

However, recent studies on consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) have shown that higher trophic level species, such as invertebrate grazers and fish, contribute nutrients via nitrogenous excretion, which can have a positive impact on macroalgal growth. As prior studies have shown metabolism to be negatively impacted by hypercapnia, projected increases in pCO~2~ associated with ocean acidification may limit excretion rates of kelp forest associated species. This experiment investigated the relative nutrient excretion rates of several grazer species and one fish species common within giant kelp forests of Southeast Alaska, where pH levels are expected to decrease by 0.4 units by 2100. Multiple individuals of *Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, Tegula pulligo, Margarites* sp., *Haliotis kamtschatkana, Pagarus* sp., and *Brachyistius frenatus* (N=8/group) were collected from Sitka Sound, AK and incubated in closed containers of UV-sterilized seawater at pH 7.8 and 7.6. Seawater was frozen and analyzed for relative concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, and urea, which were standardized to shell-free dry weight for calcified species and biomass for fish.

After just three years, fish biomass was generally greater in the Bodega Head and Stewarts Point State Marine Reserves than in paired reference sites, though abundance and biomass gains varied by species, site, and year. Effects on CPUE and mean length were similar in magnitude and direction for some sites and species, but we found neutral or negative trends in one metric with positive trends in the other metric for other species.

In rocky shore systems, predatory sea stars and rock crabs are sympatric predators of California mussels. To examine the effects of these predators on mussels, we combined a field and laboratory experiment to determine (1) the individual and combined effects of crabs and sea stars on mussel mortality, and (2) the effects of the physical and chemical presence of each predator on each other’s feeding behavior. Across three sites varying in predator abundance, the combined effects of crabs and sea stars on mussel mortality did not differ from that of crabs alone. Lab experiments validated our field results in that physically interacting crabs and sea stars did not consume more mussels than crabs alone; suggesting that the physical presence of competitors affected mussel consumption. However, whereas the chemical presence of sea stars had no effect on crabs, we found that the chemical presence of crabs increased the feeding rate of sea stars. Taken together, these results suggest that mussel mortality should be greater in environments where crabs are present versus environments where they are rare or absent, as crabs not only contribute to overall mussel mortality via consumption, but also by increasing the feeding rate of sea stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau,B.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Hull,W.W.",Humboldt State University,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

This work aims to assess black abalone status in Baja California to identify critical sites where populations are in good condition. From February 2018 to May 2019, we surveyed 26 sites from the Tijuana border to Faro San José. Preliminary results show cero abalones in 38.5% of the sites, being mainly the northern sites the ones with abalone. Densities were lower than 0.25 abalone/m². Juveniles (< 50mm) and sub-adults (60-90mm) were more abundant, and were found from cero to 1m apart. In contrast, adults (91-120mm) and harvestable size abalones (> 120mm) were very low, and the distance among individuals was > 1m. We found higher densities associated with a moderate habitat.

They were then separated into five general categories: copepods, copepodites, mysids, crab larvae, and ostracod larvae. Our results suggest that adult copepods show significant deterrence from their home reef sound on Site B, and that mysids are attracted to sound with a suggestive trend toward preferring their home reef sounds.

Preliminary results show Clorobia and Planctomycetia are more abundant on the skin of *Urobatis halleri* than in the water column. At the Class level Gamaproteobacteria are the most abundant on all stingray samples, but there is considerable variation between samples. The proportion of Gamaproteobacteria varies between 36 and 81 % of the metagenome across sting ray microbiomes. In the future, the microbiome from rays will be compared to the microbiomes of sharks and teleost fish. While sharks and rays are related, sharks are covered in dermal denticles with minimal mucus, whereas stingrays have a layer of mucus on their skin, which is a trait more similar to teleost fish. Therefore, we will analyze whether the microbiomes of the two phylogenetically related groups (sharks and rays) is more similar than the two unrelated groups, rays and fish that have a similar mucus-covered skin.",San Diego State University,"Livingston, I.G.",San Diego State University,"Peterson, M.H.",San Diego State University,"Bursch, H.A.",San Diego State University,"Dinsdale, E.A.",,,,,California Department of Fish and Wildlife,"Haggerty, M.",San Diego State University,"Johnson, C.J.",San Diego State University,"Goodman, A.Z.",San Diego State University,"Johri, S.",Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Doane, M.P.",Stanford University,"Morris, M.

"Killeen, Helen",hjkilleen@ucdavis.edu,"Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis",SMALL-SCALE NEARSHORE FRONTS CONCENTRATE ORGANISMS AND STRUCTURE COASTAL PLANKTONIC COMMUNITIES,"Fronts are boundaries between distinct water masses that often aggregate flotsam, detritus, and zooplankton. Studies of large-scale (100-1000 m) offshore fronts show that these aggregations affect ecological interactions by concentrating prey for fish, sea birds, marine mammals, and other planktivores. Less is known about the small-scale (1-10 m) fronts that are ubiquitous in nearshore environments, yet these features may have outsized importance for the many animals that utilize exclusively nearshore environments. We present findings from a study of one small-scale front that forms nearshore, north of Bodega Bay, on the north-central coast of California. We used a Tucker trawl plankton net, CTD profiler, ADCP, satellite imagery, and time-lapse photography to characterize water circulation patterns and plankton distributions within and around the front. Prior work has shown that nearshore topographically-generated fronts provide high-quality feeding patches and enhance larval retention during upwelling. The front we sampled formed only under relaxation conditions and is affected by a collection of physical processes, including flow-separation, beach circulation, and thermal stratification. Plankton accumulated at the front often in concentrations orders of magnitude greater than in nearby waters. These findings suggest that small-scale nearshore fronts are capable of concentrating planktonic organisms under relaxation conditions, likely altering ecological interactions, facilitating larval retention, and creating high-quality feeding environments for nearshore planktivores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis","Dibble, C.D.","Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis","Morgan, S.G.","Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis","Susner, M.G.","Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis","Largier, J.L.",,,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Killeen, H.J.","Coastal Marine Sciences Institute, UC Davis",,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award)

There is mounting evidence for the importance of natural enemies (i.e., pathogens and predators) in modifying density dependent vital rates in coral populations, yet the regulatory role of coral predators has rarely been investigated. We conducted a field experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia to explore the effects of predation and colony density on coral growth and survival. We found a negative, density independent effect of predators on coral survival, and a positive, density dependent effect of colony density on coral growth in the absence of predators, but no interaction between these factors.

This past year, California experienced above normal levels of rainfall, which coincided with verbal reports of decreased *Undaria pinnatifida* presence in Monterey Harbor and San Francisco Bay. To address the question of whether increased rainfall in California during early 2019 impacted the presence of *Undaria pinnatifida*, we conducted a laboratory culturing experiment that examined the responses of *Undaria pinnatifida* gametophytes to lowered salinity levels. Mature, reproductive adults of *Undaria pinnatifida* were sourced from two locations in California, Monterey Bay and Bodega Bay, and brought back to the Bodega Marine Laboratory where individuals from the two populations separately released spores. Ten replicates of each population’s spore slurry were exposed to five different salinity levels (30, 25, 20, 15, and 10 psu) over a two-month period.

The purpose of this project was to mitigate this issue by employing a novel computational approach to analyzing language relationships. We focused on 5 different families of Native Northwest Coast of North America languages, which are important due to their critically endangered and extinct statuses. We compiled a database of a pre-established list of 100 common words (the Swadesh 100 list) in the languages’ respective orthographies, then used a coding system to translate each word into its International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) equivalent. The translated words are treated analogously to DNA sequences; instead of strings of ACGT, we have strings of individual sounds (known as phonemes). The programming system compiles the data to construct phylogenetic trees of the languages. Analysis of the trees may help us to understand how these cultures interacted in the past and to assist with modern day language revitalization efforts. Our preliminary results support known relationships between the languages and have exposed previously unknown relationships. Future research on these languages, in combination with other related data (e.g. genetic and/or geographic), may support the use of this novel computational approach in order to achieve more objective results in the field of linguistics.

Cape Mendocino projects far into the Pacific Ocean, creating strong upwelling and an associated eddy that can potentially force the drifting larvae of intertidal species offshore. In addition, a large sandy stretch of coastline to the north of the Cape gives no opportunities for successful settlement by larvae of rocky intertidal species. The Cape has been identified as a biogeographic break for species with planktonic larval development, but not for direct developers. We first reviewed the literature, finding evidence of phylogeographic structure in 24 out of 46 species that have been sampled across the Cape. We then compared genetic structure across Cape Mendocino in two synchronously diverging, co-distributed intertidal gastropod species: one with planktonic larvae -  *Lottia digitalis* - and another with direct development - *Nucella ostrina.* We hypothesized that if the Cape is a barrier to larval dispersal, *L. digitalis* populations to the north and south of the Cape will show significant genetic divergence, with F~st~ values and divergence times comparable to those found in the non-dispersive *N. ostrina.* Furthermore, populations pairs that do not span the Cape will have F~st~ values close to zero.

In México there is a lack of ecological data, although it is a highly-valuable fisheries resource. The objective of this study was to study the thermoregulation of the black abalone, stablishing the preferred and critical thermal maximum, with the final goal. Forty-five juvenile abalones were obtained from Ensenada, Baja California with an average size of 2.48 cm (0.206 g) and kept at 16°C. The preferred temperature was measured with the gravitational method. Ten organisms were introduced to the gradient at 16°C. Two evaluations each 24-hour were made and their location recorded every hour; obtaining a preferred temperature of 13.8°C. Additionally, to evaluate the CTMax, a glass aquarium (40 L) was used that contained seawater at 16°C, an aeration stone and a 1000-watt heater. Two groups of 10 marked organisms were used to determine their thermotolerance. To assess the exact temperature and the point of detachment from the substrate, we used a methodology of tenacity they were on, a nylon thread was joined to the shell and a lead weight (same weight of each organism was used). The experiment started at 16°C and the temperature increase was 1°C every 15 minutes. The first abalone detached from the substrate was at a temperature of 25.4°C and the last one at 31°C; CTMax of 50% was at 29.7°C.

Parrotfishes target multiple coral species, but have high rates of focused predation on *Orbicella annularis*, an important reef building coral and endangered species. Larger bite scars have far less healing compared to smaller bites; thus greater focused predation leads to greater declines in cover of *O. annularis*. However, it is unclear how reef community composition influences the intensity of predation. The objective of this study is to examine the how the standing stock of bite scars on *O. annularis* corals scales in response to variation in parrotfish biomass and relative corallivore density,  total coral cover and relative *O. annularis* cover, and well as algae community composition. We surveyed: 1) the size and abundance of bite scars in relation to  *O. annularis* cover, 2) the relative cover of coral species, macroalgae species and other functional groups commonly targeted by parrotfishes using benthic photoquadrats, and 3) the  biomass and community composition of parrotfish species using roving diver surveys. Preliminary results show that the intensity of corallivory changed in response to site-level differences in the community composition of parrotfishes and benthic cover.

By quantifying sea otter diets and caloric intake according to recolonization patterns, we can better understand the ecosystem impacts of sea otter population increase and range expansion. We hypothesized that sea otter diet will vary according to age, reproductive class, seasonality, and time since recolonization. Foraging data was collected around Prince of Wales Island to determine diet composition during the summer. Sea otter vibrissae were obtained from subsistence hunters to assess seasonal changes in sea otter diets by using bulk stable isotope analysis. Sea otter prey items were collected in three seasons (spring, summer, and winter) to measure caloric value and stable isotopes of carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N). Sea otter diets show variation over various metrics, but the overall population-level diet composition consisted of 69% of the biomass from clams, with butter clams as the main clam species. The results of this study aids in the future management of shellfisheries, subsistence hunting, and co-management of a protected species by providing quantitative diet composition data for stakeholders.

The European green crab (*Carcinus maenas*) is invasive on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, and has the potential to impact shellfish aquaculture in the area by consuming product. We conducted a feeding experiment to determine whether *C. maenas* modifies its predatory behaviour when exposed to the effluent of the native red rock crab *Cancer productus*, which is a known predator and competitor. To determine whether *C. maenas* could have a disproportionate effect on cultured Pacific oysters (*Crassostrea gigas*) over a native predator, we also used functional response experiments to compare the predatory behaviour of *C. maenas* and *C. productus*. We found no effect of effluent on the feeding rate of *C. maenas*, suggesting that any exclusion by *C. productus* is not a result of chemical cues. We also found that predation by *C. maenas* increased asymptotically (Type II functional response) when fed increasing densities of *C. gigas*, while *C. productus* displayed a sigmoidal (Type III) response. Thus, at high prey densities we expect these two species will have comparable predation effects on *C. gigas* populations, despite *C. productus*’s considerably larger size. We predict that *C. maenas* will have a larger, potentially destabilizing, impact on low densities of *C. gigas*. If these results are consistent across prey species, this could negatively impact the native Olympia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*), which is of special concern.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Victoria,"Ens, N.J.","Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Pacific Biological Station","Howard, B.R.",Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre,"Eastham, T.M.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Lim, E.G.",Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Phytoplankton were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and relative abundance was estimated. We found that phytoplankton communities were similar in all kelp forests. There was also a transition from diatoms to dinoflagellates that corresponded with changes in upwelling patterns. While community composition was similar the abundance of phytoplankton was different inside and outside the kelp forests. This was indicated by higher amounts of chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon (POC) outside of the kelp forest.

White abalone (*Haliotis sorenseni*) was the first marine invertebrate listed as endangered via the US Endangered Species Act. To recover this species, a consortium of partners led by UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) breeds white abalone in captivity for outplanting in the wild. BML’s Captive Breeding Program has increased production of animals to outplanting size from merely a few dozen animals to thousands of animals annually in the past six years. However, production is at least an order of magnitude behind of what is necessary to save this species. In order to increase production, it is critical to understand variation in survival. The highest mortality in captive-bred abalone occurs in the first three months. Most effort has been dedicated to increasing survival at that stage; however, little attention has been given to mortality at older life history stages. Insights about mortality at these stages would optimize culture operations and inform stocking strategies. We investigated the mortality of 1- to 3-year-old white abalone grown at BML from 2016-2019. Mortality varied by animal age, spawning year, and parentage. These results can be used to identify strategies for increasing captive white abalone production for outplanting, expediting species recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Aquilino, K.M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","McNealy, J.L.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis",,Yes,

However, recent literature has suggested that photosynthetic organisms including macroalgae and seagrass could provide refugia for shellfish by modifying seawater chemistry, thus buffering the effects of OA. In this study the Pacific oyster *Crassotrea gigas* was incubated in laboratory chambers in the presence and absence of the seagrass *Zostera marina*. Incubations were conducted with both ambient (400 μatm) and elevated CO~2~ seawater (1200 μatm) and ran in both light and dark periods. Rates of calcification for oysters were measured using changes in seawater total alkalinity. The presence of seagrass appeared to enhance calcification of the oysters in ambient seawater and light treatments. However, in contrast to our hypothesis and previous studies, seagrass did not increase calcification in the elevated CO~2~ treatments. Changes in seawater chemistry produced by seagrass may not have been sufficient to counteract the negative effects of OA on oyster calcification, therefore additional analyses are planned that will investigate this possibility. Results from this study enhance our understanding of how seagrasses influence the performance of calcifying organisms, but more research is needed to elucidate the buffering capability of seagrass in response to future climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Outcalt, A.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Ricart, A.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Sanford, E.D.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Gaylord, B.P.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Hill, T.M.",,,,,,,,6,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Merolla, S.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis",,,

Rapid climate change can induce this type of eco-evolutionary response, however there must be standing genetic and phenotypic variation for selection to act upon. We tested whether different strains of an important microalgal endosymbiont, *Symbiodinium microadriaticum*, responded differently to environmental stress. We cultured five strains of *S. microadriaticum* at three temperatures, 26°C, 30°C, and 32°C, and measured growth rate, respiration, and photosynthesis. Strains responded differently to thermal stress, suggesting existing standing variation that could allow for evolutionary rescue. This is a preliminary investigation into the potential for evolutionary rescue by association in cnidarian-dinoflagellate obligate mutualisms. Most work on evolutionary rescue considers a single species, however, species interactions need also be considered when investigating evolutionary responses to climate change. Specifically, evolutionary rescue by association could occur if a mutualist is able to rapidly evolve and rescue the holobiont, without necessitating evolution in the host itself. Ongoing research will involve inoculating a cnidarian host, *Cassiopea xamachana*, with these symbiont strains to test if differential responses to thermal stress in culture are maintained in symbiosis and how these differences affect holobiont fitness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State University, Northridge","terHorst, C.P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Moffat, J.J.","California State University, Northridge",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

To do this, approximately 70-100 L of water from several of the steps in the treatment were collected. Each water sample was concentrated using tangential flow filtration and the microbial cells were collected using 0.2-μm Sterivex filters. The samples were prepared for DNA extractions and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq. Upon sequencing, the raw data was checked for quality control and using bioinformatics software, we were able to look at the organisms present in our samples. The data showed there was a substantial difference among the microbial communities in each of the treatment steps. Medically relevant microbes such as Clostridia were removed by the process and other microbes such as Chlamydia showed intermittent presence during the process suggesting a succession of species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"San Diego State University, Department of Biology","Johri, S.","San Diego State University, Department of Public Health","Pham, A.","San Diego State University, Department of Environmental Engineering","Wong, A.",Trussell Technologies Incorporated,Chen.

In California, this habitat is also home to the federally endangered black abalone, *Haliotis cracherodii*, an important herbivorous gastropod whose populations suffered from withering syndrome related mass-mortality in the 1980s. At five sites on Santa Cruz Island, CA, intertidal populations of both species were monitored annually in permanent survey plots from 2014 to 2019. Coincident with observed coast-wide mass-mortality, densities of *P. ochraceus* fell to zero or near zero at all five study locations by mid 2014, with negligible recovery and no evidence of significant recruitment over the next five years. Over the same time period, *H. cracherodii* populations fluctuated differently at each study location. Densities at three sites decreased in 2015 due in part to mortality as corroborated by direct observation of dead and dying abalone found washed ashore at one site. Densities increased at the two Western-most sites, especially from 2016-2019.

MULTIPLE SOURCES OF EELGRASS IN RESTORATION MAY HEDGE BETS IN HIGHLY VARIABLE SAN FRANCISCO BAY,"Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is valued in temperate estuaries throughout the world for services including stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for invertebrates, fishes, and birds. Eelgrass beds in San Francisco Bay have been damaged due to fill, boating, and pollutants. We have been conducting experiments to determine how best to restore eelgrass. Restoration efforts beginning in 2014 were designed to include experimental tests of donor source, replicated across sites and years. Following site selection using a habitat suitability model, we use small “test plots” to test site suitability, then expand plantings into multiple half-acre plots in which rows of transplants differ by donor (natural eelgrass beds where the plants were collected), or contain a mix of all donor sources. Preliminary results show strong effects of both donor source and year. At a site near Sausalito, plants from the closest natural bed have resulted in the greatest spatial coverage in some years. However, in other years, a further source gives the greatest coverage, suggesting that conditions in a particular year (e.g., temperature and salinity) matter. Interestingly, the mixture of sources is proving best at hedging bets, as it always contains the source that is most successful in a given year. In addition to spatial metrics, we are evaluating whether source and year interact to influence other characteristics, including densities, flowering rates, and invertebrate use. These data will inform future recommendations on whether to mix or match donors with site conditions in eelgrass restoration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,San Francisco State University,"Buchbinder, M.V.",Merkel & Associates,"Merkel, K.",San Francisco State University,"Boyer, K.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Patten, M.

Its distributional pattern suggests that temperature and salinity play important roles in limiting its distribution. However, because other factors often covary with temperature and salinity, drawing strong conclusions from these patterns is difficult. In an effort to more clearly identify the effects of these factors, we examined tolerance to acute thermal (16-28°C) and salinity (0-35 psu) stress by larvae (5-day exposure, unfed) and adults (14-day exposure, unfed) of *F. enigmaticus* in laboratory experiments. Larvae showed higher mortality at the highest temperature tested, 28°C; adult survival was unaffected by temperature. Neither larvae nor adults survived exposure to pure freshwater (0 psu), but survived well at salinities ranging from 3.5-35 psu. In addition, high salinity did not slow tube growth in adults. These results suggest that salinity stress, in particular, is not directly responsible for the frequent limitation of *F. enigmaticus* to low-salinity habitats. Experimental work on the causes of the distribution of *F. enigmaticus* is uncommon in the literature, but is likely needed to identify the abiotic or biotic factors that limit the distribution of this frequently invasive species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State University, Long Beach","Pernet,B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Peria,J.N.","California State University, Northridge",,,Organismal/Population Biology

Oysters are historically abundant animals that are commonly targeted for Living Shorelines for their added benefit of filtering water. Concrete mixed with natural materials, such as shell, formed into a dome-shape structure with holes, called a reef ball, can be used as hard substratum to promote the growth and recruitment of oysters. We are investigating whether modifying the concrete shell composition and surface texture can preferentially recruit and promote the growth of native Olympia oysters, *Ostrea lurida*, and discourage the recruitment and growth of non-native Pacific oysters, *Crassostrea gigas*. We deployed four treatment types with surface shell (crushed and full shell) or without shell (smooth and rough concrete). The full shell and rough concrete surface had added surface texture to investigate the effect of rugosity on the recruitment of oysters. Seven replicates per treatment were deployed in San Diego Bay, CA, at 0 m MLLW from May to September 2018. We measured oyster growth and recruitment and found that *O. lurida* recruited in higher numbers than *C. gigas* on all treatments, but *C. gigas* had a higher percent cover than *O. lurida* on all treatments due to its larger size. Neither species showed a treatment preference.

The topography of the island creates distinct watersheds, each of which flows out onto a distinct fringing reef area. The island’s population and agricultural activities lie mainly in watersheds on the north shore, leaving the east and west shore of the triangular island less developed. This creates a unique opportunity to study and compare the effect of a range of land use, and subsequent watershed health, on the structure of fringing reef communities. To do this we collected dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and total suspended solids data from 2017 to 2019 for nine nearshore watersheds in rainy and dry seasons. In August 2019, we conducted transects at fringing reef sites near the river mouths of these watersheds. These transects were conducted from the river mouth outwards, along a gradient of river plume exposure. Along these transects, we created an inventory of macroalgae species. With this inventory, we have examined macroalgal species richness at each site in comparison to river nutrient and sediment data. Using this relationship, we investigated macroalgae as a possible bioindicator of nutrient enrichment and identified species associated with higher nutrient levels in the adjacent river.",,,,,,,,,,,,,UC Santa Barbara,"Neumann, K.C.",UC Santa Barbara,"Burkepile, D.E.",Université de la Polynésie Française,"Zubia, M.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Pierce, K.M.",UC Santa Barbara,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Unlike many other kelp species, *Nereocystis* is an annual species that shows high seasonal and interannual variability, with recruitment, growth and survival influenced by multiple abiotic and biotic drivers. To understand the interannual dynamics of *Nereocystis*, we’ve developed a monitoring program with three objectives: 1) empirically quantify *Nereocystis* productivity, 2) determine the morphometric properties driving productivity, and 3) understand the abiotic and biotic drivers of *Nereocystis* productivity in space and time.The measurements for *Nereocystis* are new and parameter standards, to date, have not been established. We present trends from three years of seasonal surveys at three sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia. First, multiple *Nereocystis* demographics exhibit seasonal trends and inform modelled estimates of productivity. Second, dynamics of *Nereocystis* blades and stipes both contribute substantially to productivity. Finally, abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature and nutrients) contribute differentially to *Nereocystis* dynamics across months, years and sites.

Historically ecologists have focused on variation in traits among species; however, more recent studies have documented that variation in traits within a species can meet or exceed the effects of variation among species. While the consequences of intraspecific variation are mainly researched when documenting such consequences in predator-prey interactions, this intraspecific variation is not as well-studied when considering its effects on mutualisms between species.  Here we study how intraspecific variation in a coral-guard crab (*Trapezia serenei*) affects its capacity to defend *Pocillopora* corals from predatory sea stars. We subjected guard crabs to a series of behavioral tests to catalog variation in aggressive behavior among individuals and then used a mesocosm study to estimate how intraspecific variation in aggressive behaviors were linked to their capacity to deter coral predation. We found that behavioral variation in *T. serenei* significantly affected the intensity of coral predation where corals containing crabs with more aggressive temperaments lost less coral tissue to predation. This study successfully shows the importance of considering individual trait variation in mutualisms and indicates that including intraspecific variation in our studies of mutualisms can allow us to explain variation that has historically been considered noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,McMaster University,"Pruitt, J.N.",University of Georgia,"Osenberg, C.W.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Stier, A.C.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Primo, A","University of California, Santa Barbara",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

The Los Angeles Harbor breakwall is an artificial reef that provides a high relief rocky reef structure which has relatively consistent habitat features across a depth gradient from the surface typically down to 15 or 20 meters where the quarry rock meets a sandy bottom. Garibaldi (Hypsypops rubicundus) is a protected marine damselfish found in southern California from 0-25m in depth. Territorial males prepare and defend a nest consisting of different red algae to attract females. Previous studies have indicated that females prefer nests with higher area of dense turf algae. Here we examine depth specific patters of Garibaldi habitat use and nest characteristics, as an initial part of an investigation of habitat quality of natural and artificial rocky reefs. We used a scuba diver operated stereo-video system to collect data on fish size structure, density, nest, and habitat characteristics across a depth gradient, and to determine if there is a correlation between male body size and nest area. We also used more traditional scuba-based survey methods to sample nest algal composition, and other nest and general habitat characteristics to compare techniques to quantify reef characteristics. Data from Los Angeles Harbor breakwall indicates that Garibaldi size structure varies with depths, and that these differences are correlated with multiple nest characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","Claisse, J.T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Pyles, A.M.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Past studies indicate that these disturbances can trigger mass mortality of intertidal invertebrates, including important sessile foundation species such as mussels. However, little is known regarding how mortality of mussels influences the diverse communities that live within mussel beds. In this study, we documented the extent and community consequences of mass mortality of California mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) in association with a record-breaking heatwave that struck northern California during June 2019. We surveyed the percentage of mussel mortality in randomly placed quadrats in Bodega Marine Reserve and compared the abundance and composition of invertebrates within plots with a low versus high percentage of dead mussel shells. Mean mortality of mussels in the upper layer of the bed was 30.4% in the high zone, and 24.1% in the mid zone. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index did not differ between plots with a high percentage of dead mussels and those with a low percentage of dead mussels; however, the plots with a high percentage of dead mussels had a lower species richness and a lower total abundance of invertebrates. These results demonstrate that heatwaves can have immediate, negative effects on mussel bed communities, although additional research is needed to examine rates of recovery and the longer-term impacts of these extreme events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","De Leon Sanchez, E.E.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Longman, E.K.","Bodega Marine Reserve, University of California, Davis","Sones, J.L.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Sanford, E.",,,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Quan, J.R.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Mussels were collected from three locations in HB: North Bay (NB), Entrance Bay (EB), and South Bay (SB). Oysters were purchased from a commercial oyster farmer who cultivates them in the NB. Bivalves were digested with proteolytic enzyme complexes, vacuum filtered, and MP were quantified by microscopic examination of filters. All samples contained MP, with plastic fibers being the most abundant items. Significantly different concentrations of MP (plastic particles/g tissue wet mass) were found between mussels collected from different locations and from the cultured oysters (p = 0.000). Mussels from NB contained the highest average concentration of MP and were significantly different from all other groups. MP concentrations in EB and SB mussels were intermediate, and oysters contained the lowest concentrations. Half of the samples from each location were digested using the enzyme complex Corolase 7089, and the other half were digested with Corolase 8000. No significant difference in MP recovery was found between the two treatments (p=0.253). All samples treated with Corolase 8000 digested completely, whereas some of the samples treated with Corolase 7089 did not achieve complete digestion, suggesting that Corolase 8000 is more efficient for this purpose.

In our study system, the bridled goby host species (Coryphoptererus glaucofraenum) is infected by a parasitic copepod (Pharodes tortugensis) that attaches to its gills. We tested for a trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII) where predator-prey contact between Coryphoptererus glaucofraenum and predatory fish is modified by Pharodes tortugensis. Because this particular parasite is not trophically transmitted via host manipulation, the altered behaviors in parasitized gobies are instead likely coincidental to infection. Gobies compete for crevices in the reef to avoid predation and it has been previously shown that goby mortality increases more rapidly with refuge shortage for parasitized gobies than for their parasite-free counterparts. We found interactive effects of refuge shortage and parasitism on two behaviors we predicted might be associated with parasite-mediated competition for refuges. First, as refuges became scarce, the rate of aggression among gobies increased and parasitism intensified this interaction. Second, as refuges became scarce goby proximity to them increased, but parasitism nullified this response. In combination, these parasite-induced behavioral alterations may explain why parasitized gobies are poorer competitors for refuges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Rhode Island,"Forrester, G",University of Rhode Island,"Chille, E",University of Rhode Island,"Nickles, K",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Reed, K","California State University, Northridge",,,Organismal/Population Biology

We collected “healthy” (green) and “necrotic” (green with black/ brown lesions) blades from the fore, mid and back bay (n=10 each site/blade type). In the lab, half of each blade was cultured on SSW media to detect *Labyrinthula* spp., and the other dried for DNA extraction and qPCR to quantify *Labyrinthula* spp. Excess Green Index (EGI) image analysis was used as a proxy for plant health. Both “healthy” and “necrotic” blades were positive for *Labyrinthula* spp. in culture at all three sites. qPCR results (2018 samples) also confirmed *Labyrinthula* spp. on both blade types at all sites, with the greatest concentration observed in the back bay. EGI analysis showed no consistent correlation between number of parasites and severity of lesions. The ubiquitous distribution and EGI results suggest that the *Labyrinthula* spp. in Morro Bay Estuary may not be a primary pathogen, but instead is an opportunist.

Southern California beaches serve as a juvenile white shark nursery habitat, and year-round human recreation areas.  Evidence of increasing white shark population in northeastern Pacific Ocean, along with rising popularity of beach-related recreation may increase human-shark encounter probability.

For example, manipulation of burrowing crabs in salt marshes could have legacy effects if manipulations persist after experiments. Similarly, the nature of the disturbance (e.g. vegetation removal versus trampling by observers) could influence community recovery. Currently, however, our understanding of the lasting effects of experiments is lacking. We followed the recovery of experimental plots after the aboveground biomass was harvested at the completion of a 3-year manipulation of burrowing crabs in two southern California salt marshes. We surveyed crab burrows and vegetation in four plot types: 1) crab exclosures, 2) crab enclosures, 3) trampled areas surrounding exclosures/enclosures, and 4) undisturbed controls. At both marshes, burrow densities differed between treatments 1 & 2 even one year after cage removal. However, this did not translate into differences in the recovery of vegetation between these plots. Also, trampling decreased burrow density, perhaps because it shifted the community towards mud with a greater water content. But these trampling impacts were only seen at one marsh. Importantly, even after one year, experimental and trampled plots were less vegetated than controls. Thus, the recovery of salt marshes following experimental manipulations that included harvesting aboveground plant biomass may take longer than one year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,SDSU/UC Davis,"Walker, J.K.",SDSU,"Long, J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Richardson, P.J.",SDSU,,,

In temperate reefs along the California coast, the clonal corallimorpharian *Corynactis californica* provides an associational refuge to macroalgae from benthic grazers such as sea urchins. *C. californica* exhibit striking variation amongst colonies – in color, morphology, physiology, and behavior – and yet we have a limited understanding of how such variation may influence the ability of *C. californica* to defend macroalgae from grazing pressure. Here, I studied how trait variation among *C. californica* colonies influences purple urchin (*Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus*) foraging on giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*). I placed urchins in aquaria with one of three color morphs of *C. californica* and measured kelp consumption as well as urchin behavior. Overall, the presence of *C. californica* reduced kelp consumption by urchins and increased the time it took urchins to reach kelp. While urchins were least likely to consume kelp in the presence of red color morphs, the strength of the effect of *C. californica* on urchin behavior differed amongst color morphs. These findings suggest the role of intraspecific trait variation in positive interactions between *C. californica*  and macroalgae may be subtle and warrants further study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Santa Barbara","Stier, A.C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Ritger, A.L.","University of California, Santa Barbara",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

These images were used to identify individual *F. gatesii*, and each was measured (“trunk” diameter) and assessed for reproductive status. The same parameters were collected on the ground. Surveyors walked the entirety of the islands and identified individual cactus. All parameters collected through field work were compared to those collected using UAVs. Preliminary analysis shows UAVs can correctly identify 100% of *F. gatesii* greater than 18 cm in diameter, while also identifying reproductive status.

Three wildlife tunnels were built over a decade ago underneath Valley Center Road, a busy highway next to the Daley Ranch conservation area in Escondido, CA. These tunnels serve as a corridor between Daley Ranch and Lake Wohlford, two habitats that provide essential resources to the local wildlife. The San Diego Tracking Team (SDTT) has performed quarterly surveys of wildlife observations within these tunnels since 2010. We have analyzed the results of these surveys to analyze how wildlife observations in the tunnels have changed from 2010 - 2018, and if wildlife tended to prefer one tunnel over the other tunnels. It was found that there was no significant difference in the quantity of observations of each species between the three tunnels. There was, however, a significant difference in the quantity of observations of each species from year to year. Although track surveys provide insight into wildlife use of the tunnels, there are several limitations with this method. We propose the use of camera traps in the tunnels to gain a better understanding of how wildlife behave in the tunnels, when they use the tunnels, and how many individuals use the tunnels. We also hope the camera traps will provide further insight as to how often humans are present in the tunnels. Cameras are currently placed throughout the Daley Ranch reserve to analyze wildlife movements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,California State University San Marcos,"Ridder, E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Sanchez, M.L","California State University San Marcos, Sonoma State University",,,
"Schouweiler, Megan",mschouwe@ucsc.edu,University of California Santa Cruz,EFFECTS OF PH AND TEMPERATURE ON THE EXCRETION RATE AND NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF KELP FOREST GRAZER FECES,"Herbivorous invertebrate species are the primary consumers of macroalgae in kelp forest environments. These species excrete large quantities of digested, nutrient-rich material as feces, creating a nutritional subsidy for benthic detritivores that are unable to directly consume larger, intact material. As ocean environments are predicted to become warmer and more acidic, this fecal supply may decrease as the primary grazers extract nutrients more efficiently to cope with changing conditions. This study focused on the fecal output of three common species of grazers in Southeast Alaska’s giant kelp forests: green and red urchins, (*Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis* and *Strongylocentrotus franciscanus*) and pinto abalone, (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*). Twelve individuals from each species were collected from Sitka Sound, AK, placed in separate tanks with flow-through seawater and fed a diet of fresh *Macrocystis pyrifera* to satiation. Consumption and excretion rates for each invertebrate were quantified in ambient conditions (12°C, 8.0 pH) and in increased temperature and acidity (15°C, 7.6 pH). Algal and fecal samples collected during both trials were analyzed for differences in caloric content and carbon:nitrogen ratios to quantify relative nutritional quality. Preliminary analysis revealed no significant changes in consumption or excretion rates under different conditions. However, further analysis of the collected samples may demonstrate how an underappreciated food subsidy within kelp forest communities might respond to future ocean conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of California Santa Cruz,"Bell, L.E.",University of California Santa Cruz,"Kroeker, K.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Schouweiler, M.D.",University of California Santa Cruz,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Often, introduced species reduce the abundance and diversity of biota in recipient food webs. However, ontogenetic diet shifts in the introduced species can alter the presence, degree or direction of these impacts on native species, making it difficult for scientists and managers to predict the ecological consequences of species introductions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment to assess the effects of crayfish species identity and ontogenetic stage on benthic invertebrate composition and abundance as well as leaf litter breakdown by native signal crayfish (*Pacifastacus leniusculus*) and introduced ringed crayfish (*Faxonius neglectus neglectus*). Treatments with signal crayfish and adult crayfish had higher reductions in leaf litter relative to treatments with introduced crayfish and juvenile crayfish. Alpha and beta diversity of benthic invertebrates was similar among treatments, but there were fewer shredders in treatments with adult crayfish. Thus, I show that ontogenetic stage and native vs. non-native status both matter for understanding the impact of species introductions on local ecological communities and ecosystem processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Segui, L.M.",,,,

Kelp forests may provide refuge for organisms experiencing upwelling, characterized by low oxygen content and cold temperatures. As the climate continues to change, these upwelling events are predicted to intensify, thus raising concerns and questions about how organisms will respond to these new conditions. Here, we tested the effects of hypoxia on the heart rate (which can be used as a proxy for metabolism) and consumption rate of Panulirus interruptus (California Spiny Lobster). We exposed lobsters to either hypoxic (<50% air saturation (AS)) or normoxic (>90% AS) conditions for 24 hours and measured its effects on lobster 1) consumption rate of local mussel, Mytilus spp. and 2) heart rate. Hypoxia caused a noticeable decrease in consumption rate (of mussels over 24 hours) across all individuals as compared to individuals held in normoxic conditions. Preliminary results suggest that there was little difference in heart rate across individuals exposed to hypoxia versus individuals exposed to normoxia. These results suggest that severe upwelling and climate change associated hypoxia events may alter the feeding behavior of California spiny lobsters.

Concurrent with elevated water temperature during the recent ENSO in southern California, *Sargassum horneri*, an invasive brown alga, increased dramatically. To determine if growth of *S. horneri* varies with temperature and if this variation can be masked by herbivory, we are monitoring temperature and thalli growth +/- access to herbivores on Catalina Island. Twice a month we collect 20 *S. horneri* in each of 3 size classes (≤10cm, >10cm & ≤100cm, and >100cm), weigh and measure height, attach half inside cages and leave half open to herbivory. Algae and a temperature logger are deployed for 5 days then collected, remeasured, and reweighed. Deployments will be repeated September-April to capture a wide range of temperatures. We will evaluate the relationship between temperature and growth both with and without herbivores. We expect *S. horneri* will maintain growth above temperatures known to result in *Macrocystis pyrifera* decline (20ºC), but this growth can be masked by herbivory. Preliminary results for September show *S. horneri* ≤10cm grew taller when caged, but did not change weight. *S. horneri* between 10 & 100cm had grew in weight and height, with no difference between herbivore treatments.

Even when the catch of this marine resource is carried out under a regulated quota scheme, in order to ensure sustainability, its is currently classified as “vulnerable” by the IUCN. The Gulf Corvina fishery has been always directed to the breeding aggregations, during the migration of mature individuals to the UGC, so the low genetic diversity revealed by some early studies raised up the concern on the conservation status of this endemic species. A more recent study pointed out that even when the species went into a population bottleneck before the onset of the fishery, the effective population size is large enough and do not compromise its persistence on the short-term. To confirm this demographic scenario and infer the trends on population abundance we analyzed 1,506 individuals collected over the last decade to test for changes in the frequency and number of maternal lineages (maternal haplotypes). Our results do not show significant differences in genetic diversity between the 2009 and 2019 fishing seasons, but confirmed that the Gulf Corvina has lower genetic diversity than other Corvina species that inhabit the UGC and even less that in the Totoaba, another endemic species of the UGC considered as critically endangered.

Mounting position of acoustic receivers in the water column can impact detection efficiency due to factors such as refraction and reflection of the transmitted signal. A limitation of passive acoustic telemetry is often the rate at which data is obtained. Because subsurface-mounted receivers must be removed from their moorings and downloaded on the surface, time of data acquisition intervals may be months or more. Vemco real-time receiver buoys address this issue by providing real-time data via cell-networks. To have a rugged design that can withstand a potentially harsh marine-deployment, receivers must be mounted directly to the subsurface frame of a buoy. Cabled, digital receivers (VR2Rx) mounted to buoys were tested for detection efficiency and range in comparison with subsurface VR2W receivers. Range tests suggest that despite the buoy-mounted receiver being located near the surface (1 m) and VR2AR/VR2W receiver at depth (6 m), the performance between receivers was not significantly different. Subsurface receivers performed marginally better at close range (200-305 m), while the VR2Rx performed marginally better at far range (410, 565 m). Given the added benefit of real-time data combined with minimal reductions in detection efficiency, real-time buoys appear to be an important new tool in the field of acoustic telemetry. Because data acquisition is recorded and stored in real-time via cloud service, these systems are more cost and data efficient than VR2Ws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"California State University, Long Beach","Anderson, J.M.","California State University, Long Beach","Lowe, C.G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Stirling, B.S.","California State University, Long Beach",,Yes,

Juvenile English sole use coastal estuaries as a nursery habitat, which unfortunately is susceptible to anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication. Hypoxia, the deficiency of oxygen, causes an increase in ventilation rate. This increase can result in vulnerability to predators and an increase in energy exertion, which negatively affects its survivability. Six treatments of dissolved oxygen(DO) were set up in twelve tanks containing ten fish each. After two weeks, the acclimated fish(n=60) were tested in trials of two tanks per treatment with five fish per tank in an array of ten experimental chambers made of 1.5cm thick polypropylene sheet. By counting operculum movements on GoPro footage, the ventilation rate is estimated from averaging between three one-minute measurements from start, halfway, and finish of the 30-minute recording. We expect to see a linear pattern of increased ventilation rate as DO decreases. Alternatively, the ventilation rate may stay constant and rapidly increase at a lower standard. This data will serve as a reference in determining the long-term effects hypoxia has on English sole population and how its nursery habitat can be protected from anthropogenic stressors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Moss Landing Marine Labs,Helaina Lindsey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Switzer, Ethan.R",CSU Monterey Bay,,,

These systems attempt to mimic real-world conditions while altering variables such as temperature and pH in order to simulate climate change in a controlled setting. While mesocosm experiments represent a viable approach to this area of research, their implementation is often quite costly and can be inaccessible to those without substantial funding. One particularly expensive aspect is the control of experimental treatments using high-cost sensors and controller units. This project highlights a cost-effective solution for monitoring mesocosm treatments (temperature and pH, in a study of eelgrass and grazing response) through the use of DIY Arduino micro-controllers. Controllers were programmed to monitor and maintain the temperature and pH of four 55-gal header tanks at set intervals above or below the incoming seawater (+3^oC above ambient/-0.3 pH units below ambient). This allows treatment tanks to experience the same daily fluctuations as the ambient seawater, while common controllers are often restricted to static treatment values. Due to their low cost, accuracy (+/- 0.002), and general flexibility, controllers built using Arduino and accessory components are a viable way of reducing the overall cost of mesocosm experiments focused on climate change. This can in turn make studies of this nature more accessible, while maintaining highly accurate treatment levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Tettelbach, C.R.H.","Estuary & Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University",,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology

Current conservation efforts include outplanting cultured abalone to enhance wild populations. However, one challenge to the success of these efforts is the high risk of predation on captive-bred abalone, which are naïve to predators. This study aimed to investigate whether cultured white abalone exhibit defense responses when exposed to a predator, if those defenses allow the abalone to escape, and whether the abalone escape more quickly after multiple encounters. In a laboratory experiment, cultured white abalone were exposed to a predator, the Giant Spined Star (*Pisaster giganteus*), over three consecutive five-minute trials. The type and duration of abalone behaviors were recorded throughout each trial, and then compared to those observed during a control trial where abalone were touched by a non-biological sponge, as well as a baseline trial with no stimulus applied. The abalone altered their behavior when exposed to *P. giganteus* relative to control and baseline trials, effectively breaking contact with the sea star by twisting (i.e., successive rotation of the shell) and galloping (i.e., rapid directional movement). They also escaped more quickly  after the initial trial. These results indicate that cultured white abalone have an innate ability to recognize and respond to predators, and they can learn to escape more effectively  through repeated encounters with predators. Predator exposure in the laboratory prior to outplanting may thus improve their survival in the wild",,,,,,,,,,,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","Marks, L.","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","Neuman, M.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Beltran, N.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Thomasdotter, A.O.",San Jose State University,,,

We studied the impacts of crustose coralline algae (CCA), a known promoter of coral settlement, and the encrusting brown alga *Ramicrusta textilis*, an aggressive space competitor, on settlement and subsequent survival of a Caribbean gorgonian *Plexaura homomalla*. Planulae were given six days to choose between three pieces of coral rubble, which were mostly covered with CCA or *Ramicrusta* (“CCA” or “Ram”), or mostly not covered with algae (“Bare”). Settlement was greatest on CCA rubble, lower on Ram rubble, and lowest on Bare rubble. Within patches on each piece of rubble, polyps highly preferred CCA patches, showed no preference or avoidance for bare patches, and strongly avoided *R. textilis*. Survival was not different between rubble types but was significantly different between patch types. After 20 days, survival was highest on bare patches (79%), lower on CCA patches (61%), and lowest on *R. textilis* patches (41%). Presence of crust encourages nearby settlement, regardless of crust type, but patch type is a more important factor in determining subsequent survival.

However, the low growth rate and sensitivity to high water temperatures still represent important bottlenecks in the production. Interspecific hybridization between abalone species with different thermal windows has the potential to overcome these limitations, improving growth rates even at high temperatures. In this regard, RNA-seq data provide a valuable resource to identify the physiological mechanism underlying the better performance of hybrids. In this study, we describe the growth in juveniles of pure *H. rufescens* (RR) and a hybrid cross of RR with *H. corrugata* (RAm) following three months acclimation at 18°C and 22°C. To evaluate the gene expression patterns, we constructed a reference transcriptome assembly using RR and RAm samples from each temperature. Our results show a lower growth rate of RR at 22 °C than at 18 °C, whereas RAm growth was similar in both temperatures and to RR at 18 °C. The RNA-seq data confirms different expression patterns between warm-acclimated RR and RAm. However, a differential expression analysis between the 22 °C and 18 °C treatments from each cross evinced that RAm presented a higher proportion of down-regulated genes involved in catalytic activity and cellular metabolic processes. Together, these results suggest that hybrid abalone can compensate for increased temperature following different gene regulation strategies than the pure cross, allowing it to sustain growth performance even after three months of warm acclimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada, Ensenada, Mexico","Cicala, F.","Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada, Ensenada, Mexico","Chacón-Ponce, K.

To examine tolerance, we inflicted damage of 0%, 25% and 50% on leaves of wild and domesticated chilies. Tolerance was quantified as relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll and biomass allocation. Resistance measurements were leaf total phenolic content, trichomes density and survival and performance of an herbivore larval. Wild chili showed no changes between treatments on tolerance traits indicating full tolerance, whereas plants with 50% damage declined heterogeneously on RGR and fruit biomass on serrano and poblano plants, respectively. Resistance was higher in wild than in cultivated varieties. Larvae fed with wild chili leaves had a 0% survival, while a 73.33% survival was found on larvae fed with domesticated varieties. A reduction of total phenolic content was observed on 50% damaged plants of wild and poblano chili. Leaf trichome density increased only in serrano with 50% damage.

"Waite, Heidi",hwaite@uci.edu,University of California Irvine,"DOES THE APPLE REALLY NOT FALL FAR FROM THE TREE? : PARENTAL EFFECTS ON LARVAL THERMAL TOLERANCE IN THE MUSSEL, MYTILUS TROSSULUS","Under climate change conditions, marine organisms will need to cope with or adapt to increasing temperatures in order to persist. Parental effects, where offspring responses to environmental change are influenced by environments experienced by parents, may include mechanisms of coping with thermal stress. This study evaluated the degree to which thermal tolerance of larvae of the mussel, *Mytilus trossulus*, is influenced by parental environments. Adult mussels were collected from two sites of varying thermal stress on San Juan Island, WA: Friday Harbor Laboratories dock (FHL; low stress subtidal population) and False Bay (FB; high stress intertidal population). Air, water, and body temperatures were recorded in the field, and LT~50~ thermal tolerance (temperature lethal to 50% of individuals) trials were conducted on field-collected adults and their veliger larvae raised in the laboratory. Environmental temperatures and in situ mussel body temperatures were higher at False Bay (Mann-Whitney: p<0.001). Thermal tolerance was slightly higher in adults from the high stress environment than those from the low stress site. Despite predictions that larvae are more vulnerable and rarely experience such high temperatures in the water column, larval tolerances were surprisingly high when exposed to only one hour of elevated temperatures. In addition, larval tolerances were not significantly different between sites (T-Test; p=0.2424). These results raise questions about the role of parental effects in thermal tolerance and vulnerability to thermal stress across ontogeny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of California Irvine,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Waite, H.R.",University of California Irvine,,,Organismal/Population Biology
"Waldschmidt, Alexandra",ajwaldschmidt@gmail.com,University of Alaska Southeast,PINTO ABALONE CRYPTIC BEHAVIOR IN RELATION TO THEIR SIZE AND HABITAT COMPLEXITY IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA,"Pinto abalone (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*) abundance declined drastically in Southeast Alaska, largely as a result of overharvest during commercial fisheries in the 1980s and 1990s. These declines reduced abalone abundance so much that abalone are no longer found at their traditional harvesting sites. We were interested to explore abalone cryptic behavior, as it may reflect how susceptible they are to predation and may change with variation in resource availability and substrate type. We worked with a local Alaska Native tribe, the Hydaburg Cooperative Association, and local harvesters, who identified 18 traditional harvest sites with historically high abalone abundances in their region. At each site we surveyed one 20 x 2 m transect within the depth where traditional harvest occurs (1 m) and one below the reach of most traditional harvesters (3 m), but within the optimal abalone depth range. We quantified abalone density and scored each abalone’s cryptic behavior on a scale from very hidden to completely exposed. We categorized primary and secondary substrate types and calculated an overall complexity score for each transect. Because large abalone are harder to remove from the rocks making them less susceptible to predation, we hypothesize that larger abalone would be more exposed than smaller abalone. If abalone prefer to seek out resources rather than hide from predators, then abalone should be found to be exposed no matter the substrate complexity. We plan to share our results with local harvesters to provide information on the status of this valuable resource.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Bolwerk, A.T.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Eckert, G.L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Waldschmidt, A.J.",University of Alaska Southeast,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology
"Weinstock, Jane",jweinstock@whoi.edu,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,LUNAR AND TIDAL CYCLES IN BARNACLE (*CHTHAMALUS* SPP.) TIMING OF REPRODUCTION AND SETTLEMENT,"Barnacles are important competitors for space in intertidal habitats, and the timing of their reproduction and settlement plays a major role in determining their potential dispersal and ultimate recruitment. Our goal was to monitor *Chthamalus* spp. in coastal Southern California over multiple years to test whether lunar and tidal cycles play a role in local timing of reproduction and settlement. We collected 100 adult barnacles daily from June to November 2016 and May to August 2017 at Bird Rock, San Diego. We inspected individuals under a stereomicroscope and categorized them by reproductive stage, ultimately calculating the proportion of each stage per sampling date. Settlement plates were also collected and replaced daily from April to July 2014, October 2014 to January 2015, April to August 2015, September to December 2015, and April to July 2016. The number of settlers were counted and normalized by suitable settlement area. Sea level data were obtained from a NOAA tide station at La Jolla, CA, and temperature data were collected near the settlement plates. For all biological, sea level, and temperature data, we calculated and assigned each sampling date to a lunar day. We then used a randomization test to evaluate the periodicity of reproduction and settlement. Our results revealed significant periodicity corresponding to lunar and tidal cycles in *Chthamalus* spp. reproduction, but not in settlement, indicating that these patterns exist in reproduction but potentially break down during dispersal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,University of San Diego,"Reyns, N.B.",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Pineda, J.",University of San Diego,"Swiderski, M.",University of San Diego,"Flerchinger, D.",,,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Weinstock, J.B.",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,,
"Woods, Mackenzie",mbwoods@uvic.ca,University of Victoria,SHIPS AND MIDSHIPMAN FISH: HOW BOAT NOISE AFFECTS AGGRESSION AND PARENTAL CARE OF THE PLAINFIN MIDSHIPMAN FISH,"Many fishes are largely reliant on sound for communication, prey and predator detection, and navigation. Over the last century, rising levels of anthropogenic noise have been introduced into the ocean, greatly altering the underwater soundscape. The highly vocal plainfin midshipman fish, *Porichthys notatus*, has a long and energetically-costly parental care period, during which a male guards a nest and cares for his eggs. *P. notatus* relies on sound production and reception for mate attraction and agonistic encounters, including nest defence; therefore, alteration of the environmental soundscape has the potential to affect reproductive behaviour, including nest-guarding and parental care. We are conducting a two-part study to investigate the effect of boat noise on the behaviour of *P. notatus* guarder males during nest defence. Using a within-subjects design, we exposed guarder males to a nest-invading crab threat stimulus in the presence and absence of boat noise. We first conducted these experiments using fish housed in individual tanks; the captive fish exhibited more aggressive behaviours in trials during boat noise playback compared to trials with only ambient conditions. We then repeated the experiments *in situ* at an intertidal breeding site. Our results will help explain how boat noise affects fish behaviour and mediates parental care. As anthropogenic noise continues to increase, understanding how it affects aquatic organisms is crucial in order to appropriately mitigate such effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McMaster University, University of Victoria","Brown, N.A.W.",McMaster University,"Balshine, S.",University of Victoria,"Juanes, F.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Woods, M.B.",University of Victoria,,,Organismal/Population Biology
"Wu, Marissa",m.velarde@csu.fullerton.edu,Cal State University Fullerton,"EFFECT OF SHELL AND MUSCLE CONTRACTION BEHAVIOR ON GAMETE PLUMES AND EGG VELOCITIES OF THE RED ABALONE, *HALIOTIS RUFESCENS*","Abalones and other free-spawning marine invertebrates require dense aggregated populations for successful fertilization. Due to a long history of anthropogenic impacts, most Southern California abalone populations exist in low density aggregations. Reduced adult aggregations that are few and far apart may impact fertilization success. Abalones have evolved specific reproductive strategies to assist with fertilization success such as synchronized spawning and conspecific sperm chemotaxis. Abalones have also been observed to contract their muscular bodies while spawning, which may be a mechanism as yet unquantified that could assist with successful fertilization. We are examining the effects of bodily muscular contractions on gamete plume heights and gamete velocities in the red abalone, *Haliotis rufescens*. We hypothesize that the heights of ejected gamete plumes will increase with increasing contractile force, but that the gamete velocities are more density dependent. We measured the force of spawning red abalone contractions with a force transducer, while simultaneously recording the heights of the resultant gamete plumes with a GoPro, and capturing the egg particles as they exit the respiratory pores in high-speed frames of an Edgertronic camera. We measured the parameters of the plumes and gametes on Kinovea and compared them to the force data. Our novel research will enhance our knowledge of evolved abalone behaviors that assist in fertilization success and help guide out-planting strategies for on-going and future abalone reintroductions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,California State University Fullerton,"Paig-Tran, E.W.M.",California State University Fullerton,"Forsgren, K.L.",California State University Fullerton,"Zacherl, D.C.",,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Wu, M.L.V.",California State University Fullerton,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)
"Wuest, Anna",anna.wuest0@gmail.com,Florida State University / NOAA,Insights into black-footed albatross bycatch in US west coast fisheries using Bayesian models,"Globally, seabird populations are declining due to factors such as pollution, climate change, introduction of predators, and interactions with fisheries. Incidental bycatch in U.S. West coast longline fisheries significantly contributes to the mortality of the black-footed albatross (BFAL). BFAL populations are stable but predicted to decline over the next half century. My project focuses on testing multiple Bayesian time series models to understand the factors that contribute to BFAL bycatch in a U.S. West Coast longline fishery. We tested model performance assuming two different distributions of the bycatch (negative binomial, Poisson), and examined constant versus non-constant bycatch rates. We also incorporated combinations of seven unique covariates to determine if a relationship exists between these covariates and the bycatch rate. We used leave-one-out cross validation to quantitatively evaluate the models. Results indicated that the best model of seabird bycatch used a negative binomial distribution with a constant bycatch rate. These results suggest that the distribution of bycatch is dispersed and that the underlying bycatch rate from year to year remains relatively constant. Of the covariates used, streamer lines, season, and floated longlines had the most predictive results this indicates that these covariates all have the capacity to affect the bycatch rate. The results of our work demonstrate clear improvements over previous methods of bycatch modeling and suggest factors that managers might use to reduce seabird bycatch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,NOAA,"Good, T.P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster","Jannot, J.E.",NOAA,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award)
