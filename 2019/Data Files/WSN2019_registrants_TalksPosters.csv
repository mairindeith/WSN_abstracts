"Abbott, Dan",,dabbott@reefcheck.org,Special Session: Kelp Ecosystem Health and Sea Star Wasting,Ecosystem Assessment,Special Session: Kelp Ecosystem Health and Sea Star Wasting,4,Variation in the response of kelp forest ecosystems to environmental stressors along the coast of California,"From 2013 to 2015 kelp forest ecosystems along the California coast north of Point Conception underwent a series of environmental stressors, including the loss of sea star species due to Sea Star Wasting Disease; warm water events, including the warm water “blob” (2014 & 2015) and the warmest El Niño on record (2015/2016); and a large recruitment pulse of purple sea urchins. These events have caused many of the state's kelp forest ecosystems to undergo dramatic changes. However, areas along the coast responded differently to these events both due to differences in the severity of the events and due to differences in the structure of the kelp forest communities themselves. While these events have caused dramatic phase shifts to urchin barrens in many kelp forests, other sites have remained stable. Data from 52 sites collected by Reef Check volunteer scuba divers from 2006 to 2019, as part of a statewide kelp forest monitoring program, were used to compare how these events have affected kelp forest ecosystems in different regions. North of San Francisco, a transition from kelp forest to urchin barren has been widespread and persistent. South of Point Sur, kelp forests have remained stable despite the loss of a major urchin predator, the sunflower star, and in the Monterey/Carmel Bay area outcomes have varied dramatically. Some reefs have shifted to persistent barrens, others remain kelp forests, some have oscillated between the two states, while still others shifted from a giant kelp dominated ecosystem to an urchin barren and eventually to a bull kelp dominated forest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, D.",Reef Check Foundation,Reef Check Foundation,"Freiwald, J.",Reef Check Foundation,"McHugh, T.",Reef Check Foundation,"McMillian, S.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,Variation in the response of kelp forest ecosystems to environmental stressors along the coast of California,,Invitee,

It is increasingly apparent that the functions provided by the eelgrass microbiome can support host health through nitrogen fixation, sulfide detoxification, and producing agarases that prevent epiphytic algae overgrowth. However, there is a knowledge gap for how bacterial communities colonize eelgrass blades and how established communities persist. We hypothesize that eelgrass is a passive surface for bacteria colonization. We reciprocally transplanted eelgrass shoots and eelgrass analogues among four meadows with different environmental conditions. Our three treatments included: live eelgrass, dead/sterile eelgrass, and artificial seagrass units.  We determined: 1) Turnover of eelgrass microbiota when shoots were introduced to a meadow with a different microbial pool, and 2) Composition of eelgrass microbiota compared to microbes that colonize sterile/dead eelgrass and passive marine surfaces. We found that a proportion of the original bacterial community remained the same following transplanting, while some species were replaced by others, indicating that eelgrass may be selecting for specific bacteria. We also found that the microbiota on live eelgrass was different from microbiota colonizing the dead and artificial blades. These results suggest that some of the eelgrass blade microbes have a strong relationship with their host and may influence eelgrass health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adamczyk, E.M.",University of British Columbia,University of British Columbia,"O'Connor, M.I.",University of British Columbia,"Wegener Parfrey, L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,TRANSPLANT EXPERIMENT REVEALS INSIGHT TO SPECIFICITY OF EELGRASS BLADE MICROBIOTA,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

It is also ecologically important in kelp forests where it plays a key role in controlling populations of sea urchins, which can locally eliminate kelp.  Despite the importance of this species, its reproductive rates are poorly known, hampering effective management.  For 10 years, we have collected female sheephead to characterize the duration of the spawning season, the frequency of reproductive bouts, batch fecundity, and annual fecundity of females.  We also evaluated size and age at maturity for females in this protogynous species during their nearly 4-month-long spawning season. At our southern California study sites, which span from San Clemente to Oceanside, CA, there is persistent and heavy fishing pressure by recreational anglers and spearfishers. During the recent years of our study, we have noted a decrease in mature females and an increase in transitional individuals and early stage males. This indicates a shift to becoming male at an earlier size and age and even a transition prior to ever reproducing as a female. This is likely a combination of very successful recruitment during the recent warm water years, producing more females than can successfully reproduce and a heavily skewed male:female sex ratio on those reefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adreani, M.S.",California State University Northridge,California State University Northridge,"Steele, M.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT AND RECENT SHIFTS IN SIZE AT MATURITY AND SEX CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA SHEEPHEAD,,Invitee,

Despite the devastating effects that mass bleaching events have on corals, associated biodiversity and human populations, little data exist on the bleaching susceptibility of individual corals identified to the species level, and for a large proportion of the reef building coral community, limiting our potential to predict the impacts of these events at large-scales. Here, we quantify individual variation in bleaching susceptibility for some of the most common Indo-Pacific corals in two of the world’s most diverse coral reef systems: Ari atoll, Republic of the Maldives and Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We found that phylogenetic effects strongly influenced bleaching susceptibility in each region; however, the most bleaching susceptible clades differed between regions. Moreover, processes operating over shorter time-scales such adaptation and acclimatisation modified phylogenetic contributions to bleaching susceptibility. Overall, our data indicate that assessments of species’ bleaching susceptibility and extinction risk cannot be applied over wide geographic areas and suggest that phenotypic responses to mass bleaching are occurring over relatively short time scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aguirre, J.D.","Massey Univeristy Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand","Queensland Museum, Townsville, Queensland, Australia",Muir P.R.,"Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","Done, T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,"STRONG PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL FOR MASS CORAL BLEACHING WITHIN REGIONS, BUT NO EVIDENCE FOR PHYLOGENETIC CONSTRAINTS BETWEEN REGIONS",,Invitee,

New Zealand’s oldest no-take marine reserve was opened at Leigh in 1977, and the benefits for target species like the sparid snapper *Chrysophrys auratus* were described soon after. In the decades of reserve status since, a trophic cascade has been described: the recovery of targeted predator species has suppressed sea urchin grazing, leading to the loss of heavily grazed “urchin barrens” and dominance of kelp forests. The long-term effect of these changes on the wider reef fish assemblage is largely unknown. A number of flow-on indirect effects have been hypothesised, although field studies testing these are rare. We investigated how reef fish assemblages within the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point (Leigh) Marine Reserve have changed after 40 years of reserve protection (1978 and 2018). We also investigated the generality of reserve effects in three northern NZ marine reserves. 

We provide further evidence for the positive direct effects of protection and habitat changes in Leigh marine reserve, and describe several potential indirect effects. These include an increase in biomass of herbivorous silver drummer *Kyphosus sydneyanus* with the proliferation of kelp forests and a decline in spotted wrasse *Notolabrus celidotus*, perhaps in response to predatory fish recovery.

Transgenerational Plasticity of Olympia Oyster Larvae,"Transgenerational plasticity can play an important role in the adaption of marine species to climate change. To test the potential for transgenerational effects in the Olimpia oyster (*Ostrea lurida*), we outplanted adult oysters to four sites in Puget Sound, Washington (for six-months) and determined if in situ conditions have the potential to affect the success and fitness of their offspring. Puget Sound’s unique and variable oceanography serves as an exceptional “natural laboratory” to examine in a field setting the effects of seasonal anoxia, ocean acidification, extreme warming, algal blooms, and seasonal shifts in the pycnocline. Oceanographic conditions were coupled with biological measurements by placing shellfish cages onto the mooring line of Oceanic Remote Chemical Analyzer (ORCA) buoys. Higher growth in outplanted oysters was associated with high temperatures and thermal variability in the field. Larvae from parents outplanted to different sites did not show differences in growth when reared at 14°C but larvae whose parents experienced warmer temperatures grew up to 66% larger at 20°C. For all sites, larvae held at 20°C had better survival than at 14°C. Strong parental effects were observed in larval respiration. Short-term experiments revealed that larvae from parents exposed to the lowest thermal variation in the field (9-14°C) had higher respiration rates at 20°C (the thermal optimum).

"Angwin, Renee",,rangwin@sdsu.edu,Applied Ecology,Conservation and Restoration,Applied Ecology,7,ECOLOGICALLY RESTORATIVE AQUACULTURE OF PURPLE SEA URCHINS (STRONGYLOCENTROTUS PURPURATUS),"Over the last decade, the rapid expansion of urchin barrens along the coast of California has created an overabundance of purple urchins that exert destructive grazing pressure on essential kelp forest habitat. Although the harvesting of several urchin species has led to high-value fisheries worldwide, purple urchins presently have little to no commercial value, especially in a malnourished, barren condition. By harvesting purple urchins from barrens and enhancing their roe through aquaculture, we can transform these destructive grazers into high-quality seafood that also benefits ecological restoration of kelp forests. We collected purple urchins from barrens and fed them natural kelp or two different formulations of artificial feed in a recirculating aquaculture system. The gonad index (GI) of urchins fed the two artificial diets doubled in 6 wk, increased from a barren condition to a marketable yield (GI > 15%) in 9 wk, and was significantly greater than the GI of urchins fed kelp. Analyses of amino acids in gonad tissue also revealed important differences among the three diets. In particular, concentrations of glycine, which correlates with sweet tasting roe, and tyrosine, which correlates with bitterness, differed between the two artificial feeds, suggesting one feed has greater commercial potential. These results highlight an untapped potential to quickly produce a highly valued, consistent seafood product from seemingly low-value purple urchins. Echinoculture may thereby serve as a tool to stimulate urchin industries and restore kelp forests from urchin barrens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angwin, R.E.",San Diego State University Coastal and Marine Institute,San Diego State University Coastal and Marine Institute & Dept of Biology,"Hentschel, B.T.",San Diego State University Coastal and Marine Institute & Dept of Biology,"Anderson, T.W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,ECOLOGICALLY RESTORATIVE AQUACULTURE OF PURPLE SEA URCHINS (STRONGYLOCENTROTUS PURPURATUS),,Invitee,

A recent extreme warming event (2014-2016) of unprecedented magnitude and duration in the California Current System allowed us to evaluate the response of the kelp forest community near its southern distribution limit. We obtained sea surface temperatures for the northern Pacific of Baja California, Mexico, and collected kelp forest community data at three islands, before and after the warming event. The warming was the most intense and persistent event observed to date, with anomalies 1°C warmer than the previous extremes during the 1982-1984 and 1997-1998 El Niños.  The period between 2014-2017 accounted for ~50% of marine heatwaves days in the past 37 years, with the highest maximum temperature intensities peaking at 5.9°C above-average temperatures for the period. We found significant declines in the number of ""Macrocystis pyrifera"" individuals, except at the northernmost island, and corresponding declines in the number of fronds per individual. We also found significant changes in the community structure associated with the kelp beds: half of the fish and invertebrate species disappeared after the marine heatwaves, species with warmer affinities appeared or increased their abundance, and introduced algae, previously absent, appeared at all islands. These results suggest that the effect of global warming can be more apparent in sensitive species, such as sessile invertebrates, and that warming-related impacts have the potential to facilitate the establishment of tropical and invasive species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Nur Arafeh-Dalmau,"ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia.","Instituto de Investigaciones Oceanológicas, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico",Gabriela Montaño-Moctezuma,"Facultad de Ciencias Marinas, Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Ensenada, Mexico",José A.

The rich information gathered there has allowed the construction of one of the most complete ecological networks. However, these studies have ignored the microbial component of these networks, precluding a holistic insight on the functioning of this ecosystem. Here, we attempt to disentangle the ecological interactions between the macro- and microscopic marine organisms, focusing on both trophic and non-trophic interactions in the rocky intertidal shore. We first characterized the assemblage of grazers, showing that *Fissurella crassa*, *Scurria araucana*, *Chiton granosus*, *Siphonaria lessoni*, and *Echinolittorina peruviana* have the highest potential to impact biofilms, according to abundance, body size, radula characteristics, and the foot mucus production. Our results showed significantly different negative effects between the mucus of *F.crassa and *S.lessoni on the coverage of photosynthetic epilithic biofilms. Grazing by *F.crassa and *C.granosus had the most significant negative impact on biofilms, and the other three species had no effects. After characterizing the microbial community by microscopy and molecular approaches, we found intertidal zones differences. Finally, our study allows us to classify intertidal grazers into functional groups according to their impacts on biofilm and the differences in their trophic and non-trophic effects on the microbes are starting to unveil the myriad of interaction pathways connecting macro and microscopic marine organisms",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arboleda-Baena, C.M.","Estación Costera de Investigaciones Marinas, Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Las Cruces, Chile","Laboratorio de Microbiología Marina, Departamento de Genética Molecular y Microbiología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas,  Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile","Pareja, C.B.","Laboratorio de Microbiología Marina, Departamento de Genética Molecular y Microbiología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas,  Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile","De la Iglesia, R.","Instituto de Ciencias del Mar – CSIC, Paseo Marítimo de la Barceloneta, 37 – 49, 080003 Barcelona, Spain","Logares, R.","Estación Costera de Investigaciones Marinas, Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Ciencias Biológicas, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Las Cruces, Chile; Marine Energy Research & Innovation Center (MERIC), Avda.

Shallow and deep-sea ctenophore species were examined to explore the enzymatic constraint of depth ranges. Native enzymes from different ctenophore species were assayed at 1, 200, 400, and 600 atmospheres; after undergoing pressure treatment, the enzymes were assayed at 1 atmosphere (recovery). Maximum rates of enzyme reactions (Vmax) were recorded during each pressure treatment and recovery to investigate the effects of pressure. The glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) has exhibited adaptive pressure resistance in deep-sea fishes, and was initially targeted for comparison; malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were also assessed for pressure tolerances. When saturated withsubstrate, both PK and MDH showed decreasing pressure inhibition with habitat depth, though
pressure’s effect on PK was more pronounced. Extremely deep species living below 2000 m
disrupted this relationship in a manner consistent with historic data collected from vertebrates.
Our initial results support two intriguing hypotheses: (1) that relationships between
environmental conditions and enzyme volume change parameters are consistent across the
longest branches of the animal tree of life, and (2) that pressure inactivation of an enzyme under

Previous work identified freezes as the primary factor setting mangrove range on the Atlantic coast of North America. However, on the Pacific coast, the range limit for mangroves occurs in Baja California (BC), an area that does not experience freezes, raising questions about processes controlling the Pacific mangroves range. 
We conducted lab experiments and distribution modeling to compare the fundamental and realized niches of mangroves along both coasts. Mangroves were collected from populations near both range limits, grown under controlled conditions, and submitted to two sets of experiments to characterize their tolerance to cold air and water temperatures. Seedlings were put in coolers with water temperatures spanning from 30°C to 13°C. We also simulated overnight freezes in chambers ranging from -0.5°C to -15°C. Their survival was monitored for six months. We developed correlative distribution models using climate and mangrove presence/absence data to see if the experimental thresholds matched the realized mangrove niches. 
The Atlantic mangroves air temperature mortality thresholds matched thresholds identified from distribution models, validating that these populations are indeed controlled by the occurrence of freeze. For the Pacific coast, the current environmental conditions at the range in BC are not at the tolerance limits of mangroves, implying that mangroves could be controlled by other factors such as species interactions or dispersal limitation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bardou, R","University of California, Los Angeles","University of California, Los Angeles","Cavanaugh, KC","Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Smithsonian Institution","Parker, JD","Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, Smithsonian Institution","Feller, CI",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,Variability in the fundamental and realized niches of mangroves in Baja California,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

As the only abalone species native to the state, their decline is a loss for indigenous tribes, recreational divers, and the health of rocky reefs and kelp beds. Puget Sound Restoration Fund and Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife are working to restore populations in the San Juan Islands. As this restoration occurs, however, climate change is causing ocean acidification (OA) and warming in the northeast Pacific, further threatening pinto abalone recovery. The purpose of this research was to inform best hatchery practices for restoration and to better understand the tolerance and physiological flexibility of wild abalone larvae under future climate change scenarios. We exposed abalone post-fertilization to four treatments for ten days: 1) ambient pH + hatchery rearing temperature, 2) low pH + hatchery rearing temperature, 3) ambient pH + high temperature, and 4) low pH + high temperature. Abalone in the ambient pH + hatchery rearing temperature treatment had the best survival, those in the low pH + high temperature treatment had the worst survival, and those in the two single-stressor treatments had survival in between. This indicates an additive effect of the stressors.

To test, inform and promote innovative sustainable seafood production strategies in the Northeastern Pacific, we designed an experimental mariculture system at San Jeronimo Island, Baja California in collaboration with the local fishing cooperative. Specifically, this pilot experiment aimed to explore the feasibility of rearing red abalone *Haliotis rufescens* during its early stages to a larger size for a future local restocking program. We also tested the effects of two different depths, surface and bottom (6 m) and three different macroalgae diets on the survival and growth of juvenile red abalone (30 ± 8 mm), using a long line system. Our results show a 7.22 ± 0.27 mm mean increase in shell length after four months of experiment, which appears to be greater than for abalone raised in the lab. We did not find any effect of depth or macroalgae diet treatments.

Chemical and physical settlement cues utilized by barnacle and mussel larvae,"Recruitment of larval organisms from the plankton to the substrate is the mechanism of population growth for most marine species and is one of the most important processes controlling intertidal ecosystems. Mussels and barnacles recruits are incredibly important to their ecosystem because they provide food and habitat to many other intertidal species. However, very little work has been done on the mechanisms that induce settlement from the plankton onto the rocky shore. It is known that both mussel and barnacle recruits prefer to settle on rough surfaces such as established adult barnacles. Recent studies have identified two chemical cues that also may play a key role in barnacle and mussel settlement: MULTIFUNCin in the barnacle Balanus glandula and KEYSTONEin in the mussel Mytilus californianus. However, the importance of the roughness of a surface versus the chemical cues are unknown. In this study, we made and deployed plastic molds of barnacle-covered (rugose) and smooth rock that had either no chemical cue, barnacle cue (MULTIFUNCin), or mussel cue (KEYSTONEin) in the intertidal for multiple days to determine if recruits or predators respond to surface rugosity and/or chemical cues. We found that barnacles generally preferred rugose over smooth surfaces. However, barnacle settlement was high regardless of rugosity in the presence of mussel chemical cues, and barnacle settlers did not respond to barnacle chemical cues. These results suggest that barnacle settlers may avoid competition with conspecifics, but may preferentially settle on or near mussels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bauer, K.K",,,"Menge, B.A",,"Gravem, S.A",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,Is this the place?

We tested three common corals (*Acropora millepora*, *Pocillopora damicornis*, and *Porites cylindrica*) for defenses against the thermally-regulated bleaching pathogen *Vibrio coralliilyticus* - comparing defenses of individuals from coral-dominated marine protected areas (MPAs) versus algae-dominated fished areas. All corals possessed defenses, but the magnitude of pathogen suppression varied across species, and for *A. millepora*, defenses were suppressed if individuals grew in algae-dominated versus coral-dominated areas. Reciprocal transplantation between MPAs and fished areas demonstrated that *Acropora* defense was variable; defense increased if moved to coral-dominated areas and decreased if moved to algae-dominated areas. Defenses were not altered for the ecologically hardy poritid coral or the weedy pocilloporid coral. We also tested whether specific species of macroalgae differentially impacted *Acropora* defense.

The role of LA in buffering populations from climate change is uncertain given the influence of other processes, such as plasticity. Here, we test the presence and extent of LA and plasticity in a marine snail, *Nucella lamellosa*, using reciprocal transplants and a common garden experiment. We transplanted four populations of snails from two regions in British Columbia that differ in oceanographic conditions, and measured growth and survival over six months. We also held all populations in mesocosms for 2.5 months under factorial temperature and pH levels that simulated current and future oceanic conditions in each region. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence of LA in any population in either experiment: populations transplanted within their native region demonstrated lower growth rates relative to foreign transplants; and source population did not affect snail growth in the lab. However, we did observe plasticity in growth and feeding rates across thermal gradients. We also observed high mortality across all populations in southern transplant sites and treatments that simulated southern climate change scenarios, indicating that environments in these regions may be approaching lethal limits for certain species.

Therefore, a better understanding of the ecological ramifications of thermal anomalies and land-based pollution on coral reef ecosystems is necessary. In this study, we used thermal performance curves to quantify the shape of the relationship between metabolic rates (photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification) of *Pocillopora acuta* and temperature at high and low pollution sites in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. We also measured key physiological parameters including chlorophyll a content, endosymbiont densities, tissue biomass, and tissue nitrogen content. We found that corals at low pollution sites exhibited higher endosymbiont densities, and chlorophyll a content. Furthermore, we found that corals from low pollution sites exhibited higher maximum rates of performance (Pmax) and rates at a constant temperature (b(Tc)) for gross photosynthetic and respiration rates. Respiration rates exhibited higher thermal optimums than gross photosynthetic and calcification rates. Gross photosynthetic rates had higher activation energy (E), Pmax, and b(Tc) than respiration and calcification rates. These results indicate that higher levels of land-based pollution can negatively influence corals’ metabolic response to thermal stress. Understanding how local anthropogenic stressors influence corals’ response to temperature is integral information for coral reef management to help mediate the influx of pollution into coastal coral reef ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Becker, Danielle.

The sudden removal of giant kelp fronds by disturbance events, like storms, enhance space and light for the colonization of opportunistic species, altering local community composition. Understanding the mechanisms by which macroalgal species compete can provide insight into recovery following canopy removal and predicting future community structure. This study experimentally tested independent and combined effects of how three different algal competitive mechanisms (shade, scour, unique organismal effects) affect recruitment of two early life stages of *M. pyrifera* in the Point Loma kelp forest in San Diego, CA. *M. pyrifera* macroscopic recruitment and growth were recorded under each treatment. Scour, regardless of shade, negatively affected *M. pyrifera* survival, recruitment and growth and had the greatest negative impact on macroscopic sporophyte recruitment, while shading negatively affected macroscopic sporophyte growth. Canopy-removing events, like storms, are increasing in frequency and intensity and this change could facilitate the rise of opportunistic species, like *Desmarestia herbacea*, to alter community succession and inhibit *M. pyrifera* recovery.

These sea anemones, which are hosts to symbiotic unicellular algae, must maintain relatively low body temperatures to maintain their endosymbionts. If temperatures are too high, the partnership between host and symbiont breaks down. It is therefore necessary for *Anthopleura* to maintain consistent, cool body temperatures even when low tides expose them to environmental fluctuations. Anemones slowly release water from their bodies at low tide to maintain cooler temperatures via evaporative cooling. Mobile invertebrates take advantage of this behavior and congregate under the edges of anemones during low tides. We hypothesize that anemones increase biodiversity in the upper intertidal zone by providing favorable microhabitat. We designed an experiment that manipulated anemone microhabitat at three sites along a gradient in temperature and desiccation conditions. Treatments included anemone removal, anemone addition, and adjacent bare-rock controls. We surveyed invertebrates and measured temperature and relative desiccation in these plots over several weeks before and following manipulations. Temperatures were up to 6° C lower and relative desiccation was lower next to anemones than on adjacent rock. Mobile invertebrate biodiversity was higher in anemone plots than in adjacent bare-rock and removal plots, but community changes were also site-specific.

Spatial and temporal variability in recruitment rates, influenced by factors including habitat availability and oceanographic conditions, are major determinants of rockfish population dynamics throughout the Eastern Pacific, but while many new recruits utilize kelp canopy as habitat during this critical life history stage, the degree to which this impacts their survival has not yet been investigated along California’s north coast, where *Nereocystis* bull kelp beds are declining annually. Using standardized fish traps and monthly benthic SCUBA surveys targeting multiple life stages, we examined the effect of kelp abundance on the recruitment and survivorship of several rockfish species along the Mendocino coastline. Additional factors of rocky relief, understory algae abundance, predator presence and temperature were considered. Modeling results suggest that while rockfish recruits typically associate with *Nereocystis* canopy, individuals may be utilizing alternate habitats as kelp becomes less available. If kelp beds continue to decline, the influence of factors such as relief and understory algae abundance on rockfish recruitment success and survival may increase.

Between September 2014 and January 2016, we tagged 184 yellowtail with conventional (Floy) tags in inshore and offshore areas throughout the SCB. 22 of the tagged fish were fitted with Vemco acoustic transmitters. To date, 22% of tagged fish have been reported recaptured. As further evidence of high fishing pressure, tag returns coincided with periods of maximum fishing effort. For electronically-tagged yellowtail, typical daily movements regularly extended outside the scope of the region’s two marine protected areas. Additionally, larger fish were more likely to be consistently detected throughout the year, suggesting that larger yellowtail may remain resident year-round. This finding lends credence to previously untested claims that some yellowtail are residents in certain SCB nearshore habitats. Results also indicate there is one contiguous population of yellowtail in the SCB. However, due to elevated fishing pressure, this population may rely on seasonal influxes of southern fish to sustain itself. This reliance on northward migration into the SCB could mean a climate-mediated northward range-shift would expose a greater percentage of the west-coast yellowtail population to elevated fishing pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ben-Aderet, N.J.",NOAA - Southwest Fisheries Science Center,Scripps Institution of Oceanography - UC San Diego,"Sandin, S.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,UNDERSTANDING YELLOWTAIL (*SERIOLA DORSALIS*) MOVEMENT IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BIGHT THROUGH ACOUSTIC AND CONVENTIONAL TAGGING,,Invitee,

Small, isolated islands with endemic species offer an opportunity to groundtruth population size estimates with empirical data and investigate the genetic consequences of such small popu- lations. Here we focus on two endemic species of reef fish, the Clipperton damselfish, *Stegastes baldwini*, and the Clipperton angelfish, *Holacanthus limbaughi*, on Clipperton Atoll, tropical eastern Pacific. Visual surveys, performed over almost two decades and four expe- ditions, and genetic surveys based on genomic RAD sequences, allowed us to estimate kin- ship and genetic diversity, as well as to compare population size estimates based on visual surveys with effective population sizes based on genetics. We found that genetic and visual estimates of population numbers were remarkably similar. *S. baldwini* and *H. limbaughi* had population sizes of approximately 800,000 and 60,000, respectively.

These problems present challenges for large and small aquaculture operations alike and are sometimes resolved by the collection, preservation, and storage of algae for later use. The impact of macroalgae preservation on abalone production is not well described, therefore the goal of this research was to determine if common preservation techniques affect the growth of juvenile abalone. Red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*) juveniles were fed dried, frozen, and fresh giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) while also being exposed to the scent of macroalgae prepared using each method. Change in length and wet mass was measured over the course of 22 weeks and short-term food consumption rates were determined to elucidate potential impacts on feeding behavior. Preliminary data analysis indicates that while abalone fed fresh and dried kelp had no significant difference in mass or length change, abalone fed frozen kelp gained significantly less mass than did abalone fed fresh kelp (2-way ANOVA, p=.006). Exposure to the scent of various kelp preparations had no effect on growth, and neither treatment appeared to impact consumption rate.

In this study we combine tagging and stable isotope analyses to learn more about the spatial and trophic ecology of this species to inform our knowledge of risks associated with these threats. We are tagging fish in the La Jolla kelp forest using internal acoustic tags to track movement across years and seasons. We are also performing bulk stable isotope analyses using samples from individuals throughout their range to look for regional and ontogenetic patterns in their trophic ecology. Initial tagging results show that fish are spending considerable time outside of marine protected areas where they are susceptible to incidental catch by recreational fishers. Initial stable isotope results indicate no relationship between δ^15 N and fish size, location, or time of capture (year or season). For δ^13 C, we found a significant relationship between and fish size, but no relationship with location or time of capture (year or season).

Actions included seawater buffering during sensitive developmental stages, tailoring settlement and grow out temperatures, and querying natural genetic variation responsible for tolerance to OA. Abalone cultured and settled under OA during the larval phase had 30% greater survival to two months compared to abalone cultured and settled as larvae under control pH. Tailoring grow out and settlement temperatures significantly increased abalone growth such that abalone settled at 14°C and grown at 18°C were 27% larger than animals cultured settled at 11°C and grown out at 14°C; however, this positive temperature effect was only observed when these animals were raised under control pH.

What is unclear is how nutritional quality of the remaining kelps varies among species or geographically. Nutritional quality of the dominant kelp-forest forming species *Eularia fistulosa* was compared to five understory species (*D. viridis, A. clathrus, A. clathratum, L. longipes* and *S. latissimi*) and alginate properties of E. fistulosa were compared throughout the archipelago to measure geographic variability. As predicted, alginate yield, viscosity and strength all showed their maximum values in more exposed sites and increased with increasing distance from the continent, presumably because wave exposure affects their mechanical strength. In contrast, there was no major differences in nutritional quality between the species examined. The percent of the thallus made of the different molecules (proteins - 12.1%, Lipids - 0.35%, fiber - 5.5%, and energy content -2230 cal/g) were all similar among species. Only the total mineral (lower) and carbohydrate (higher) content composition in *A. clathratum*differed, compared to the other species.

The scenario is supported by increased abundance of oceanic fish and a change in the composition of mollusks in the archaeological remains.

The degree to which spatial thermal variation drives patterns in the distribution and abundance of species depends on both the strength of thermal effects and the degree to which local effects are swamped by movement among thermal microhabitats. Here, we take advantage of tide pools, which differ in temperature from emergent rock and from one another, as an ecologically important feature of the thermal landscape. This project examined the species-specific responses to tide pool temperatures in two herbivorous gastropods (*Littorina sitkana* and *L. scutulata*) in two habitats that differed in the likelihood of dispersal among pools: pools distributed across a flat rocky shoreline vs. pools situated on top of an array of tall (~1m) wood pilings. Through lab-based experiments, we found that *L. scutulata’s* thermal tolerance and herbivory rates exceeded those of *L. sitkana*. Between the two field contexts, we found a relationship between tide pool temperature and abundances of *L. sitkana* relative to other littorinids in the more disconnected mud flat site but none in the more connected flat site, and that more individuals moved out of and between tide pools on the flat shoreline than in the vertical pilings.

When these organisms are exploited, effective conservation plans must account for variation in environmental and anthropogenic impact across their entire range. The United States and Mexico share several productive ecosystems (e.g. salt marshes, kelp forests) and fisheries in both countries target many of the same species. The spiny lobster, Paulirus interruptus, represents one of the most lucrative fisheries in both California and the Baja peninsula. Using a limited number of genetic markers, previous work has established that despite the year long pelagic larval duration of spiny lobster, some pairwise population differentiation exists within their range (Pt.Conception to Bahia Magdalena). We aimed to expand on these results by using next-generation sequencing (RADseq) to identify and analyze thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the entire lobster genome.

Motile organisms are moving out of the actual range pushed by increasing temperatures, ocean acidification and low oxygen levels among other stressors. In contrast, sessile organisms have to cope with the changes, in place, once they settle and metamorphose. The goal of this collaborative project is to explore whether an important aquaculture species, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, can be “climate-proofed”.  Conceptually, our approach relies on transgenerational plasticity (TGP) as a means to “heat harden” early-stage oysters, with the idea that such priming of the progeny via adult conditioning will result in a hardier spat and juvenile oysters in an aquaculture setting in the future. On facilities at UABC, we will condition adult oysters to high temperatures, and then test whether their progeny are more tolerant of heat stress as embryos and larvae.  Experimentally, our goal is to assess the performance of the progeny using methods that assess metabolism, growth and in addition, we plan to use molecular tools where we will ask whether the thermal history of the oyster broodstock is transferred to their offspring via an epigenetic response. The latter will be performed using a methylation-sensitive polymorphism amplification (MSAP) assay developed in the lab at UCSB.

The Pacific red rock crab (RRC; Cancer productus) is among a paucity of urchin mesopredators in throughout California. We conducted field experiments to test four hypotheses relevant to the potential for RRC to facilitate the reforestation of urchin barrens: (1) mortality of PSUs from barrens increases in the presence of RCC, (2) increased PSU mortality increases survivorship of small kelps, (3) RCC predation causes PSUs to restrict their foraging distribution, and (4) this behavioral response is induced by conspecific death, rather that the mere presence of RCC.  We found that RCC causes both direct mortality and shifts in foraging distribution of PSUs from barrens, which leads to increased survival of young kelps, and that the behavioral response of PSUs is in response to conspecific deaths, not the mere presence of RCC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Mark H.

We applied network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef sharks (*Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos*) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution. Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll. Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous deposition of 50.9 kg d−1 of nitrogen around the atoll, with approximately 86% of this probably derived from pelagic resources.

In particular, ecologists have had difficulty determining how the individual and combined effects of multiple environmental drivers interact to determine synchrony, and whether these effects vary across spatial and temporal scales. Using several new statistical techniques, we characterized spatial synchrony in populations of the giant kelp *Macrocystis pyrifera*, a widely-distributed marine foundation species, and related it to synchrony in oceanographic conditions across 35 years and >900 km of coastline in California, USA. We discovered that three ecological processes (wave disturbance, seawater nitrate, and oceanographic climate) combine and interact synergistically and antagonistically to produce population synchrony, but that these interactions differ between regions on short, medium, and long timescales.

However, new sources of high-resolution satellite imagery may allow for fine-scale mapping of changes in kelp abundance. Between 2014 and 2016 the coast of California experienced a marine heatwave that led to large-scale declines in kelp cover. Using long-term Landsat satellite data, we identified regions in Northern and Southern California that experienced declines in kelp cover during this disturbance. We assessed the potential for using 3m resolution Planet imagery to monitor recovery on fine spatial scales and identify remnant, persistent kelp beds. The response of kelp to this marine heatwave varied within and between sites, demonstrating spatial variability in recovery patterns to extreme warming.

Specifically, open ocean deoxygenation occurs in regions called Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs). OMZs are midwater masses at depths of about 200 to 1500 meters and contain the world’s largest reservoirs of hypoxic waters, comprising ~ 7% of total ocean volume. Climate change is expanding OMZs worldwide and is likely to have implications for marine organism populations and global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. For example, deoxygenation may alter the distribution and decrease the biodiversity of fishes, ultimately affecting fishing yields, and may also increase the production of N~2~O, a potent greenhouse gas.

We hypothesize that the hypoxic conditions found in different OMZs (both the Southern California Bight and the Benguela current ecosystem) will lead to unique elemental signatures in fish otoliths, which are similar to earbones and grow to reflect the surrounding environmental conditions much like the rings of a tree. Through the analysis of different fish species, we were able to detect common elemental patterns in the otoliths of those species living inside OMZs, across different ocean basins. This unique elemental signature was significantly different from that of a shallow marine fish species living outside the OMZs. By using fish as “mobile monitors” of hypoxic conditions, we seek to elucidate how the past, current, and future deoxygenation processes are likely to affect fish growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cavole, L.M.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0250, USA","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0250, USA","Gallo, N.D.","Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway","Salvanes, A.G.V.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0250, USA","Ramírez-Valdez, A.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0250, USA","Levin, L.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0250, USA","Aburto-Oropeza, O.","Department of Environmental and Forest Biology, State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York, 13210, USA","Limburg, K.E.",,,,,7,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),FISHES AS “MOBILE MONITORS” OF HYPOXIC CONDITIONS ACROSS OCEAN BASINS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Evidence suggests that corallivore feeding may alter coral microbiomes in ways that contribute to dysbiosis, but corallivore feeding strategies are diverse – complicating generalizations about the nature and extent of their impacts on coral microbiomes and the fitness of the holobiont in general. Using a combination of field-based approaches, we found that feeding by *Coralliophila violacea*, a parasitic snail that significantly suppresses coral growth, can alter *Porites cylindrica* microbiomes in ways that may be indicative of dysbiosis, but that impacts are localized. Changes in microbial community composition and variability were restricted to locations where snails were attached and feeding; microbiomes from nearby (≤1.5 cm) and more distant (6-8 cm) locations on the coral did not differ from control corals without snails. The microbial impacts of *C. violacea* feeding are limited and may be under different evolutionary constraints than more mobile corallivores that forage across and among hosts.

Under experimental acidification, predators from the population with the least natural exposure to low pH showed increased search time but decreased handling time, possibly caused by a behavioral response to leave the acidified water immediately after ingestion. Predators from the population with intermediate low pH exposure showed the opposite responses, and those from the population with greatest natural exposure to low pH showed almost no response to experimental acidification. Total consumption time varied by population only, where consumption time was longer in populations with less natural low pH exposure.

The recent invasion of the Western Atlantic by Indo-Pacific lionfish (*Pterois* sp.) has reduced native fish biomass on some coral reefs but the effects of these predators on reef nutrient dynamics have not been assessed. We tested the extent to which lionfish change the function of native fish communities as nutrient sources on coral reefs using an 18-month-long large-scale experimental manipulation of lionfish densities on patch reefs in Eleuthera, The Bahamas. We also evaluated the relationship between native reef fish vulnerability to lionfish predation and their overall contribution to nutrient supply. High densities of invasive lionfish caused declines in small and medium-sized native prey fish over 1.5 years. Similar changes in biomass were not seen in large size classes of fish, which contributed the majority of reef-wide ammonium excretion. As a result, the limited reductions in native fish excretion caused by lionfish predation on small fish were roughly matched by inputs from lionfish excretion, resulting in overall maintenance of reef-wide ammonium budgets. Native fish with high vulnerability to lionfish predation contributed negligible amounts to overall reef-wide ammonium budgets due to their small size and low abundance. Thus, from a functional perspective, nutrient provisioning by reef fish appears to be robust to invasive lionfish and, in areas with high lionfish densities, reefs may actually experience enhanced nutrient supply, at least over short time scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cote, I.M.",Simon Fraser University,Ocean Wise,"Francis, F.T.",University of Alberta,"Green, S.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,WHAT GOES IN MUST COME OUT: INVASIVE PREDATORS CAN MAINTAIN REEF NUTRIENT DYNAMICS BY REPLACING NATIVE FISH EXCRETION,,Invitee,

We observed a diversity of outcomes, although the majority of species fit a few broad biogeographic regions. Repeated coalescent simulation of a simple vicariance model of the last glacial maximum yielded a wide distribution of pairwise Φ~ST~ that was very similar to empirical distributions observed across five putative barriers to gene flow. Three of these barriers had median Φ~ST~ that were significantly larger than random expectation. Only 21 of 52 species analyzed with distance-based redundancy analysis rejected the null model, with overwater distance being the dominant predictor of structure. Although there is support for three previously described barriers, phylogeographic discordance in the Indo‐Pacific Ocean indicates incongruity between processes shaping the distributions of diversity at the species and population levels. Among the many possible causes of this incongruity, genetic drift provides the most compelling explanation: given massive effective population sizes of Indo‐Pacific species, even hard vicariance for tens of thousands of years can yield Φ~ST~ values that range from 0 to nearly 0.5.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crandall, E.D.","Department of Biology & Chemistry, California State University, Monterey Bay, Seaside, California, USA","School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia","Riginos, C.","Texas A&M University Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, Texas","Bird, C.E.","Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand","Liggins, L.","School of Life and Environmental Science, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, Australia","Treml, E.A.","Faculty of Biological Sciences, School of Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom","Beger, M.","Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California","Barber, P.H.","College of Science and Engineering, James Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia","Connolly, S.R.","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia","Cowman, P.F.",15,"Yes, I would like to give a talk","School of Molecular and Life Sciences, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia","DiBattista, J.D.","Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida","Eble, J.A.","Gulf Coast Research Laboratory, University of Southern Mississippi, Ocean Springs, Mississippi","Horne, J.B.","Marine Biology, Ecology & Biodiversity, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium","Kochzius, M.","Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, University of Hawai’i at Manoa, Kaneohe, Hawaii","Toonen, R.J.","Department of Biology, University of Central Florida, Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster, Orlando, Florida","Gaither, M.R.",Yes,,The molecular biogeography of the Indo‐Pacific: Testing hypotheses with multispecies genetic patterns,,Invitee,

Patterns of morphological evolution in pectoral fins of most batoids are constrained due to their dual use in feeding and swimming. Skates use their pectoral fins to capture prey by “tenting”, and employ undulatory swimming for locomotion. However, the manta rays and their relatives (Myliobatidae) have evolved distinct pectoral fin domains that are functionally dedicated to feeding (cephalic lobes) or swimming (modified pectoral fins). Due to the presence of cephalic lobes, the mobulids have been referred to as the only vertebrate with three paired appendages. However, we found no evidence that cephalic lobes develop independently from pectoral fins nor of independent posterior patterning by HoxD, and conclude that cephalic lobes are neither independent nor novel appendages. Myliobatid cephalic lobes and pectoral fins exhibit adaptations associated with specialized feeding or oscillatory swimming, including a redistribution of pectoral fin rays in the Myliobatidae and Gymnura that arose multiple times independently in association with pelagic flight and oscillatory swimming. In an analysis of differential gene expression from comparative RNASeq data and in situ hybridization, we identified candidate genes that are likely associated with subtle changes in paired fin development that may be responsible for morphological disparity among batoids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Karen Crow,San Francisco State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,HOW THE DEVIL RAY GOT ITS HORNS: THE GENETIC BASIS OF BODY PLAN REMODELING IN MANTA RAYS AND THEIR RELATIVES,,Invitee,

However, few studies have simultaneously measured metabolic performance and predator-prey interaction strengths across temperatures, which may be important for predicting how the functional role of predators will shift across thermally heterogeneous environments. We explore the relationship between metabolism and interaction strengths across temperatures in the CA spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus). We acclimated lobsters to 11, 16, 21, and 26℃, then used respirometry to measure standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR, MMR), and aerobic scope (AS). We then quantified species interaction strengths by conducting feeding assays using the California mussel as prey and fit functional responses to individual- and treatment-level data. We found that AS and handling times were highly variable among individuals in all temperatures. Despite this variation, SMR and consumption increased with temperature.

In Southern California, the dominant seagrass is *Zostera marina*, which occasionally co-occurs with the ephemeral and regionally understudied *Ruppia maritima*. Clarifying differences in the habitat value provided by these two species is increasingly necessary as regional climate models predict *Ruppia* proliferation into areas traditionally occupied by *Zostera*. This two-year study examined *Zostera* and *Ruppia* beds growing within a 13-acre tidal lagoon in Long Beach, CA. Seagrass beds were sampled for vegetation characteristics, abiotic parameters, and benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates. Turion densities were positively correlated with macroinvertebrate abundances, and both turion density and invertebrate abundance values were greater in *Ruppia* beds than in *Zostera*. Furthermore, differences were observed in the temporal persistence of above-ground structure for each species. *Zostera marina* remained perennially present, while *Ruppia* cycled between winter senescence and spring recolonization. *Ruppia* and *Zostera* may therefore provide similar structural roles as macroinvertebrate habitat, but inconsistency in *Ruppia’s* persistence over time may prevent the development of communities traditionally associated with seagrass presence. This study offers insight into the regional role of *Ruppia* and may be useful in management considerations for this increasingly relevant species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Da Silva, N.J.","M.S.

In James Bay, it provides food for ducks and geese, which in turn provide invaluable cultural and provisioning services to coastal communities of the Cree first nation. Until the late 1990’s James Bay was home to an extensive eelgrass meadow (*Zostera marina* L.) that was thought to be among the largest in North America. The extent of eelgrass habitat, as well as canopy density and height, have declined since 1998. Over this same period, Cree report severe declines in goose abundance during their spring and fall hunting seasons, and attribute these changes to declines in eelgrass. In partnership with Cree land users, we surveyed areas likely to host eelgrass along James Bay’s eastern coastline to document its current abundance, distribution, and associated biota. This is the first publicly available survey on this scale of James Bay eelgrass assemblages. We documented shoot density, height, epibiota composition, and used eelgrass morphometrics to assess growth rates and reconstruct recent growth. We are testing hypotheses that salinity, ice-off timing, and nutrient availability affect eelgrass presence and growth. We also compare James Bay eelgrass and associated biota to eelgrass meadows on Canada’s Pacific Coast and in the St. Lawrence River (QC).

Understanding marine metapopulation dynamics and persistence is particularly challenging because most of the connectivity takes place through dispersal of tiny larvae. Though the theoretical understanding of population persistence is well-developed, this theory has rarely been applied in the field. Here, we assess persistence for a metapopulation of yellowtail clownfish (*Amphiprion clarkii*) along the coast of Leyte, Philippines. Clownfish are particularly well-suited to metapopulation studies, with limited movement as adults and a relatively short pelagic larval duration. Using mark-recapture and genetic parentage methods, we estimated survival, reproduction, and dispersal to understand and characterize persistence mechanisms, taking into account uncertainty in demographic estimates. We found that the 19 subpopulations along our study region of coastline have persisted over seven sampling years with stable abundances. However, we did not find evidence that any patch could persist individually by retaining enough of its own offspring or that the set of sites could persist in isolation. Our findings suggest that we have sampled a ‘sink’ portion of a larger metapopulation and that our sites rely on recruits from outside areas to persist.

Especially in the tropics, subsistence harvesting of wild meats – fish and mammals – provide substantial protein to remote populations. Such small-scale harvest systems are prone to poor management, nonenforcement of harvest rules, and inadequate monitoring. In such data-deficient systems, quota-based management rarely ensures sustainability. Recently, spatial protections have been touted as an easier and more robust form of management, capable of balancing human demands for food with ecological sustainability. But protected areas are far from a panacea; many offer little-to-no benefit to those who rely on wild foods. Nevertheless, governments are increasingly interested in spatial protections for the sake of food security and sustainability. For example, state governments in Malaysian Borneo have discussed implementing *tagal hutan*, spatially- and temporally-dynamic reserves to regulate terrestrial bushmeat hunting. As a first assessment of this proposed management system, I simulated the outcomes of dynamic reserves in a multi-species harvest system over a 50-year time horizon. I then applied Bayesian decision analysis to highlight the susceptibility of spatially protected harvest systems to uncertainty in hunter behaviour, prey responses, and ecological conditions.

Nevertheless, in the Mexican Pacific and Sea of Cortez cold-water bleaching has been reported several times in the past decade, mainly during the spring season. Then, to gain insight into the response to decreased temperatures, which are more frequent in this region, we conducted prospective samplings in a small but important coral community in the Mexican Pacific during the spring season on April (2016) and February and May (2017). We observe a sudden decrease in seawater temperature (≤ 20 ° C) in April 2016.

For example, because herbivores display species-specific feeding preferences for invasive seaweeds and harvesting of herbivore populations may affect target species differentially, shifts in grazer composition associated with grazer loss could change a community’s susceptibility to invasion–even in the absence of herbivore invasions. In southern California, the loss of an abundant native herbivore, black abalone *Haliotis cracherodii*, may have resulted in a shift in the native herbivore community to one that does not include an herbivore that readily fed upon invasive the rockweed, *Sargassum horneri*. To test this hypothesis, we compared the feeding preferences of black abalone and three abundant herbivore species (black turban snails, blue-band hermit crabs, and striped shore crabs) when offered agar-based foods made from either *S.horneri* or kelp, *Macrocystis pyrifera*. Black abalone readily ate both choices and did not distinguish between the two. In contrast, the three other herbivore species that dominate these herbivore communities today, strongly preferred *M.pyrifera* and almost completely avoided grazing of *S.horneri*.

An artificial reef has been defined as a submerged structure placed on the seabed to mimic some characteristics of a natural reef (UNEP-MAP, 2005). They are usually sunk to promote marine life and increase diversity. Community structure is controlled by the successful settlement of species which may then become dominant. The goal  was to study benthic recruitment on two types of substrates: steel and PVC plates located in the artificial reef Uribe 121, placed in Rosarito, Baja California over a period of one year.
A total of 90 plates (15 x 15cm) were placed at two depths: 19 and 27m on March  2016. Experimental plates were suspended vertically and periodically recovered using scuba diving. Two replicates from each depth were randomly recovered monthly. 
Salinity ranged between 33.4 to 34 PSU, temperature varied between 11.3° and 16.5°C. A total of 29,109 organisms were collected: 18,023 on metal plates and 11,086 on PVC plates, they correspond to 82 and 46 taxa respectively. Before the arrival of invertebrate colonizers we observed diatoms and filamentous green and red algae on metal plates, PVC plates were colonized mainly by green algae. First zoobenthic colonizers in metal and PVC plates were crustaceans “Ischyrocerus sp”, “Perotripus sp”, Jassa sp”, “Metopa cf. dawsoni”, “Erichtonius sp”, followed by molluscs ""Crepidula"" sp, ""Hermissenda sp""; later polychaetes Serpulidae, Syllidae, Nereididae and Chrysopetalidae.

Though body temperatures of intertidal organisms are strongly influenced by their vertical height on shore and their microhabitat, we can utilize these microclimates to evaluate the sensitivity of mussels to rising temperature. We utilized strong temperature gradients around 24 large intertidal boulders near Bodega Bay, CA to test the effect of small changes in temperature stress on the centimeter-scale vertical distribution of *M. californianus*. We sampled mussel cover in 575 quadrats and temperature of mussel biomimics during summer in 48 microhabitats.  We modeled how cover and maximum body temperature covaried with shore level, compass heading, and incline. We then generated 3-D “flyover” maps of interpolated mussel coverage and predicted maximum mussel temperature throughout the boulder field. We found that on eastern faces receiving morning sun during summertime low tides, and on flatter surfaces, mussels were scarce.

This hinders our ability to determine baseline shark abundance, understand natural variation in shark communities over time and space, and interpret sharks’ functional roles on coral reefs in natural and human-impacted systems. Here, we explore the use of dermal denticles, the small tooth-like scales that cover the bodies of sharks and rays, as a new tool for reconstructing historical shark communities on coral reefs. We compared denticle assemblages extracted from low-energy mid-Holocene (~7ka) fossil reefs in Bocas del Toro, Caribbean Panama with modern reefs in the same area to investigate how shark communities have changed over time. Denticle accumulation rates (denticle count per amount sediment per unit time) were, on average, five-fold higher on the fossil reefs than on the modern reefs, implying that these reefs supported many more, or larger, sharks 7000 years ago. Furthermore, we observed a significant shift in the relative abundance of denticle morphotypes over time. *Abrasion strength* denticles belonging to demersal sharks (e.g. nurse sharks) increased in relative abundance on the modern reefs, whereas *drag reduction* denticles, which are associated with fast-swimming species (e.g. requiem and hammerhead sharks), decreased in relative abundance, suggesting an ecological shift in shark communities on these reefs.

Unfortunately, the heavy chains and spanner lines associated with these moorings disturb the benthos, crushing the rhodoliths and altering their communities.

Specifically, we measured the amount of oxygen produced and consumed by intact and crushed rhodoliths, and the dominant invertebrate taxa in a closed bottle system. We observed a gradual decrease in oxygen in the system due to respiration taking place and we observed an increase in oxygen in the system due to photosynthesis. Our results suggest that crushing the rhodolith thalli does not immediately impact mass-specific rates of photosynthesis or respiration, but over time both will increase but at different rates.

In Baja California, Mexico, *C. mydas* was driven to near extinction by a largely unregulated fishery from the early 1950s to the 1980s, with no validated abundance data available for this time frame. In collaboration with local fishers, we applied ethnographic methods (e.g., participant observation, semi-structured interviews), to document LEK and obtain corroborated, systematized qualitative data to understand the socio-environmental complexity of this green turtle fishery. We then synthesized and quantified LEK to generate a standardized and statistically reliable LEK-derived Catch-Per-Unit-Effort (CPUE) time-series back to the early 1950s.  This approach allowed us to transform qualitative data into  statistically reliable quantitative data, and generated a baseline abundance level which revealed that the most critical decline occurred between 1960 and 1980.

These vegetated coastal habitats play a large role in the global capture and storage of carbon and have been characterized as “blue carbon ecosystems”. Seagrasses, in particular, have been classified as the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world, with storage of up to 25 billion tonnes of C. Seagrass meadows are also one of the most widespread habitats in shallow coastal systems and are declining worldwide. The recolonization of sea otters (*Enhydra lutris*) in Southeast Alaska after a more than 150 year absence provides a rare opportunity to investigate the impact of apex predators on seagrass (*Zostera marina*) community structure and carbon sequestration across a large temporal and spatial scale. We identified a positive relationship between sea otters and seagrass; however, we also found significant disturbance of intertidal seagrass habitat by sea otters digging for clams. The upper tidal limit of seagrass varied as a function of sea otter activity, with lower seagrass areal cover with high sea otter disturbance. Preliminary analyses suggest sedimentary carbon content in seagrass meadows was higher when sea otters were present, suggesting that sea otters may facilitate carbon sequestration. The net effect of sea otters on seagrass appears to be positive, supporting their role as a keystone species in seagrass meadows and coastal ecosystems in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eckert, G.L.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Raymond, W.W.",Sonoma State University,"Hughes, B.B.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Mattson, C.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Shields, M.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Domke, L.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Cates, B.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Stephens, T.A",,,8,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,"APEX PREDATORS, SEAGRASS COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, AND BLUE CARBON: ARE SEA OTTERS KEYSTONE SPECIES IN ALASKAN SEAGRASS MEADOWS?",,Invitee,

Two key questions were: how quickly can gooseneck barnacles recover and what are the impacts of by-catch on the California mussel beds in which they grow. We cleared 42 plots of various sizes on six harvest rocks in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada. We returned to these plots after one year to measure the regrowth of gooseneck barnacles and understand how California mussels help to facilitate this recovery.  We found that smaller plots cleared in deeper mussel beds have faster recovery rates and reduced mussel by-catch.

Ongoing studies of *Cyanoplax* cf. *caverna*, a small chiton that broods, and *Siphonaria brannani*, a siphon limpet that lays benthic jelly masses with embryos that  likely crawl away, are each relatively common on multiple islands of California’s Channel Island Archipelago, but are unknown from the nearby mainland coast. Although much of the islands remain unexplored for these relatively high intertidal molluscan grazers, comparisons of mitochondrial gene sequences (16S and COI), and a nuclear intron gene region for the chiton, have revealed that each species also has a striking pattern of phylogeographic structure. For populations on different islands, or in one case even on different sides of an island, substantial genetic divergence was observed, with little or no within population variation. The unusually restricted distributions of these populations, inferred to have limited dispersal, and the curious absence of either species from the mainland, could be attributed to similar ecological factors. They could be out-competed by more widely dispersing species of mostly larger-bodied grazers on the mainland, or they might have a refuge from predation pressure on islands. These competitors or predators could be less successful at recruiting to an island habitat if their planktonic larvae are swept away by currents, unlike the direct developing island endemics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eernisse, D.J.",Cal State Fullerton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,ISLAND LIFE: WHAT TWO MOLLUSCAN ENDEMICS ON CALIFORNIA’S CHANNEL ISLANDS REVEAL ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE CONTRASTS IN MARINE ANIMALS,,Invitee,

These stressors have the potential to cause phase shifts to less productive ecosystems. A major challenge for ecologists is to identify ecosystem attributes that enhance resilience and can buffer systems. In this study, we used the Northern Channel Islands, California, as a model kelp forest ecosystem that had been perturbed from the loss of a sea star predator due to a sea star wasting disease (SSWD). To determine the mechanisms that prevent phase shifts from productive kelp forests to less productive urchin barrens, we compared pre- and post-disease predator assemblages as predictors of purple urchin densities. We found that prior to SSWD, the sunflower sea star exerted strong predation pressures and was able to suppress purple urchin populations. After the disease outbreak, which functionally extirpated the sunflower star, we found that the ecosystem response depended on the abundance and size of other predators. Inside Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), the prevalence and size of other urchin predators suppressed purple urchin populations and prevented phase shifts. However, outside of the MPAs, where urchin predators are fished, less abundant, and smaller; urchin populations grew dramatically in the absence of sunflower stars. Our results demonstrate that protected trophic redundancy inside MPAs creates a net of stability that could limit kelp forest ecosystem phase shifts when perturbed.

The presence and density of recruits differed between the two sites, the depths surveyed, and between months, with greatest recruitment occurring during June and September at Intake Pipes in 6-8 m. Abalone settlement at Catalina was lower than in Baja California, Mexico where there were 20-152 settlers per m^2 (Rossetto et al. 2013).

This work aims to compare growth and gonad development (GSI) of red sea urchins fed with native and non-native macroalgae. We developed a laboratory experiment to: 1) estimate the difference in growth and gonadal development of juvenile red sea urchins after six months of exclusive feeding them with one of the three species of macroalgae and 2) test which algae is preferred by sea urchins. We found that urchins fed with S. horneri had lower growth and GSI compared to urchins fed with U. pinnatifida and M. pyrifera. We also found that urchins seem to preferred M. pyrifera and U. pinnatifida, however, they definitively did not choose S. horneri. Our findings suggest that the ecological effects of U. pinnatifida on red urchins growth and reproduction should be significantly lower compared to the effects of S. horneri.

Theoretical, modeling, and laboratory studies have generated hypotheses that larval fish size, age, growth rate, and development rate affect their susceptibility to predation. Empirical data on predator selection in the wild are challenging to obtain, and most selective mortality studies must repeatedly sample populations of survivors to indirectly examine survivorship. While valuable on a population scale, these approaches can obscure selection by particular predators. In May 2018, along the coast of Washington, USA, we simultaneously collected juvenile quillback rockfish (*Sebastes maliger*) from both the environment and from the stomachs of juvenile coho salmon (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*). We used otolith microstructure analysis to examine whether juvenile coho salmon were age-, size-, and/or growth-selective predators of juvenile quillback rockfish. Our results indicate that juvenile rockfish consumed by salmon were significantly smaller, slower growing at time of capture, and younger than surviving (unconsumed) juvenile rockfish, providing direct evidence that juvenile coho salmon are selective predators on juvenile quillback rockfish. These differences in early life history traits between consumed and surviving rockfish are related to timing of parturition suggesting that maternal effects may substantially influence survival at this stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fennie, H.W.","Hatfield Marine Science Center, Oregon State University","Hatfield Marine Science Center, Oregon State University","Sponaugle, S.","Cooperative Institute for Marine Resources Studies, Oregon State University","Daly, E.A.","Fish Ecology Division, Northwest Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA","Brodeur, R.B.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,PREY TELL: QUILLBACK ROCKFISH EARLY LIFE HISTORY TRAITS AFFECT SURVIVAL IN PREDATION ENCOUNTERS WITH JUVENILE COHO SALMON,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

To understand the role that internal tidal waves play during the last 2 km that larvae must travel before reaching the shore, we evaluated high-frequency changes (hourly) in the abundance and vertical distribution of target meroplankters (gastropods, oysters, barnacles, and bryozoans) using a cross-shore sampling array (2 km, 1.3 km and 10 m from shore) during a period of strong internal tidal forcing in summer. Concurrent measurements of temperature, currents, and winds helped to identify the mechanisms occurring while meroplankton abundance was measured. Semidiurnal internal waves dominated the temperature and current fields, especially from the midwater to the bottom, and were most likely responsible for aggregating organisms at different sites depending on their habitat preferences. Also, some taxa appeared to be delivered to the coast by the interaction between breaking internal tidal waves and onshore winds, showing for the first time an interaction between both forcing factors as a mechanism of delivery.

We contend that previous studies which examine the carbon footprint of global fisheries in aggregate have, in the absence of detailed data, very likely underestimated the footprint of small-scale fisheries. We provide evidence of this using high-resolution fisheries data generated by voluntary monitoring efforts in Northwest Mexico, combined with landings data reported to the Mexican government. Additionally, we calculated the “emissions intensities” of various seafoods produced by small-scale fisheries throughout the region, comparing the footprint of these to other sources of animal protein such as industrial wild catch and terrestrial livestock. Some of these small-scale seafoods (like clam and crab) may offer low-carbon to moderate-carbon sources of animal protein, while others (like shrimp) do not.

No-take marine reserves are a widely recognised conservation tool in restoring and preserving biodiversity and provide a spatial refuge for intensely exploited species. However, highly mobile predators, especially those that make use of both reef and soft-sediment fauna are usually not fully protected by small marine reserves. Long term population monitoring of the southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) within New Zealand's first established no-take marine reserve (Goat Island) has shown a decline to pre-reserve numbers. This could potentially be explained by individuals making offshore migrations across the reserve boundary, where fishing is permitted. These movements appear to follow after energetically demanding events, such as mating and moulting. Previous laboratory studies have also indicated that migrations occur at times when captive lobsters are consuming the most food. Therefore, it is hypothesised that lobsters could be making offshore movements in search of energy-rich offshore feeding grounds. To understand the reasoning behind these offshore movements a grid of sediment grabs were conducted to describe the distribution of potential lobster prey. Additionally, different reef and sand prey species were tested for possible feeding preferences and to describe lobster feeding patterns, handling times and energetics.

Less understood is how these losses lead to changes in species interactions, specifically the feeding networks that create food webs. The loss of sea otters across the Aleutian Islands has led to the ecological release of sea urchins, an increase in their grazing intensity, and ultimately to the formation of sea urchin barrens that are characterized by high urchin densities, low abundances of fleshy macroalgae, and high cover of crustose coralline algae. To estimate how this kelp loss impacted the ecosystem’s food webs, we compared food web structure among nearshore kelp forests and urchin barrens, and offshore communities across 10 Aleutian Islands. We constructed food webs for each habitat using primary producer and consumer stable isotope values (carbon δ13C, a proxy for food source, and nitrogen δ15N, a proxy for trophic level). Our results indicate that the loss of kelp forests and their associated biodiversity leads to a loss of stable isotope variation for entire communities, suggesting community-wide dietary niche contractions and homogenization of energy flow pathways. These contractions were caused by reduced dietary niche breadth for primary and secondary consumers and decreased trophic levels for fishes and secondary consumers.

The bright blue coloration in the flesh of some lingcod has also been hypothesized to be diet-related. We collected lingcod from 7 regions (Alaska, Puget Sound, Coastal Washington, Oregon, and Northern, Central, and Southern California) to study variation in the trophic ecology of lingcod across their full range. We analyzed the multivariate fatty acid composition of muscle tissue from 175 fish (n=25 from each region), as an indicator of their time-integrated assimilated diets and ‘trophic niche’ across space. The fatty acid composition of lingcod differed by region (p=0.003) and with color (p=0.002) but not by sex (p=0.24), with no interactions. The multivariate dispersion in fatty acids did not differ among regions.

To understand the ecological role of JWS and the degree of interaction with artisanal fisheries and develop strategies to minimize these interactions, we are using several approaches. Semi-structured interviews applied to 77 fishers along the coast of VB helped to describe artisanal fishing activities, showing that target species are potential prey of JWS and indicating that the higher interaction areas are in nearshore habitats close to the mouth of the Ojo de Liebre lagoon (OLL). Passive acoustic monitoring of 17 JWS (tagged at VB and California, US) inside and outside OLL indicate that there is a higher number of JWS detected in months with lower incidental catches. Carbon and nitrogen bulk stable isotope analyses revealed a higher contribution of demersal prey heavily targeted by local fisheries to JWS isotopic values, as well as a partial overlap in the isotopic niche with hammerhead sharks of similar sizes.

We document the effect of sea star wasting disease on population size and sea star size structure in response to SSWD around Calvert Island, British Columbia. Sea star wasting disease was first documented at Calvert Island in the winter of 2015. We conducted expert intertidal and subtidal diver surveys; in the rocky intertidal (2014-2019), seagrass beds pre- and post-wasting (2014-2018), and in kelp beds monthly during initial disease spread (2015).

This study tested for the effect of such forests on understory invertebrates through analyses of macroalgae in Moorea, French Polynesia, and octocorals in St. John, US Virgin Islands. Each forest type was quantified by height and density of component organisms and their ability to occlude down-welling photon flux density. Communities within canopies were quantified from the number of scleractinians in Moorea, and all macroscopic invertebrates in St. John. Algal forests were formed from moderately tall and dense patches of *Turbinara ornata* that occluded 0–40% of down-welling light. Octocoral forests formed tall and sparse patches that occluded 0–67% of down-welling light. 18 scleractinians were found in algal forests, and that community was unaffected by variations in canopy characteristics; invertebrate communities within octocoral forests included 26 scleractinians and members of six other phyla. These communities were also unaffected by variations in canopy characteristics. Both types of forests created transient heterogeneous light regimes, however, only algal forests effected the photosynthetic induction time of Porites spp. Overall, the results suggest that natural variations in these forests do not affect the community structure of understory invertebrates, yet, corals in dense macroalgal forests were better able to utilize temporally variable light regimes than those in sparse forests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Girard, J.F.",California State University Northridge,California State University Northridge,"Edmunds, P.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,ANIMAL AND ALGAL FORESTS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND CORAL PHOTOPHYSIOLOGY IN UNDERSTORY COMMUNITIES,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

However, increasing anthropogenic disturbance may cause their mortality and impair their role as habitat. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) serve as foundation species on reefs globally. Yet our understanding of the factors driving epifaunal assemblages associated with CCA remains limited. This study examined the importance of flow environment, thallus partial mortality, and morphology (e.g., interstitial volume, branch density, and thallus rugosity) in structuring epifaunal assemblages within the branch-forming CCA species, *Lithophyllum kotschyanum*, on a back reef in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. A total of 1,879 invertebrates were removed from 52 *L. kotschyanum* thalli, the majority of which were crustaceans (accounting for 78.4% of the total). Regardless of the flow environment, thalli with high levels of partial mortality supported assemblages with similar abundances and significantly higher taxa richness than entirely live thalli. Assemblage abundance and richness increased with interstitial volume (available living space) and lower branch density, which were morphological traits associated with higher partial mortality of algal thalli.

However, current methods for evaluating marine biodiversity are costly, time and labor intensive and require substantial taxonomic expertise. New environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques offer an alternative approach for monitoring marine biodiversity that is rapid and affordable. Recent studies demonstrate eDNA is an accurate and highly sensitive species detection tool, out performing traditional fish biodiversity surveys. However, to be maximally useful for the monitoring of MPAs, eDNA must also be able to detect both species diversity and estimate relative abundance. To determine the efficacy of eDNA for MPA monitoring, we collected eDNA samples inside and outside of 25 reserves in the Southern California MPA network. At each site, 3 replicate eDNA samples were taken at 50m intervals along a 150m transects and compared to visual census surveys by the Kelp Forest Monitoring Program and Reef Check California. 12S rRNA metabarcoding sequence data from eDNA revealed a far broader diversity of marine vertebrates than underwater visual census surveys, demonstrating a significant advantage of eDNA.

Consequently, fish communities in these ecosystems are subject to changes in their assemblages and abundances. In this study, we analyzed changes in the fish community at Los Peñasquitos Lagoon as a response to the effects of oceanographic processes variability over the last 30 years. Our results showed that the different species of fish have different responses to oceanographic processes variations, and anomalies in the physical-chemical water parameters. Multivariate statistical analyses suggest that the principal causes of community changes have been strong coastal upwelling conditions, warm water temperature anomalies, strong ENSO events, and the lagoon’s inlet closures. 
ENSO conditions and warm water temperature anomalies are favorable for the invasive species like mosquitofish, *Gambusia affinis*, but negative for the lagoon’s dominant species, topsmelt, *Atherinops affinis*.

For example, along the northwestern American coast, the canopy forming annual kelp *Nereocystis luetkeana* (Order Laminariales) is commonly epiphytized by the macroscopic stage of the annual rhodophyte *Pyropia nereocystis* (Order Bangiales). I studied the dynamics of this interspecific interaction at the southern limit of the *Nereocystis*’s range. Using a mixture of field sampling and *Nereocystis* collections over multiple years, I investigated morphometric characteristics of the host and spatiotemporal variability in the host and epiphyte populations. I hypothesized that morphometric characteristics of the host would positively correlate with the biomass of the epiphyte, and that temporal maxima of host densities would correspond with epiphyte frequency of occurrence (% epiphytism) maxima. *Nereocystis*’s total length positively correlated with *Pyropia* total dry weight, but did not correlate with *Pyropia*’s distance along the stipe. Furthermore, using two mixed-factor ANOVAs, neither *Nereocystis* density nor *Pyropia* frequency of occurrence varied spatially, although both varied temporally and interacted spatiotemporally. Additionally, a lag period existed between establishment of host canopies and epiphytism, which is interesting given that both species are annuals.

In this study, we studied whether predators stimulate inducible defenses of sea urchins, in temperate kelp forests in Southern California. We hypothesized that inside of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), where fishing is completely restricted or limited, urchins would be better defended than in fished areas due to the recovery of predators in the MPAs. We collected urchins from four management zones that varied in predator and resource abundance and measured variation in two defensive traits: crush resistance and spine length. While we did not find strong differences in crush resistance between management zones, we did document significant variation in spine length. However, this variation was related to resource abundance but not predator abundance. This suggests that resource availability may interact with urchin behavior to influence this trait; urchins need to develop longer spines because they are exposed while searching for food when it is scarce, placing them in higher risk of predation even when predator abundance is low. Interestingly, we found small-scale difference in habitat resulted in strong variation in gonadosomatic index and spine lengths between sampling zones directly adjacent to one another. Understanding the morphological differences of purple urchins inside and outside of these MPAs is pertinent in comprehending how different management actions impact predator-prey dynamics in California kelp forests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grathwohl, R.G.",Colorado College,"University of California, Santa Barbara","Davis, K.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Caselle, J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,Do purple sea urchins alter their morphology in response to variation in predator abundance and resource availability?,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Prior research showed that growth rates, recruitment rates, and physiology of rocky intertidal species were sensitive to one or more of these climatic patterns. Whether sensitivity in these processes translates into emergent community-level sensitivity to climate variation is unclear. We used an 11-year dataset (2006-2017) from 10 sites in Oregon and northern California. We asked whether the community structure, the direction or rate of community change, the abundance of focal functional groups, or biodiversity correlated with yearly fluctuations in PDO, NPGO, ENSO and upwelling. Contrary to expectations, community structure responded weakly to yearly variation in the 4 climate modes (each contributing 2.7% or less). Similarly, we found no effects on the direction or rate or community change, abundance of functional groups, or biodiversity.  We conclude that previously established sensitivity of ecological processes to climate mode does not translate into sensitivity in community structure. Possible reasons include that many taxa are long-lived, can regenerate after disturbance, can plastically respond to stress, and are controlled by top-down forces.

Despite its high plasticity, salinity conditions are expected to decline below the range of conditions typically experienced by this species due to increased precipitation from climate change and Mississippi River diversions. To predict the future of the species, we used a breeding experiment to determine the capacity of *C. virginica* to adapt to future declines in salinity. Parental oysters from a single population in Louisiana were raised and acclimated in either a high or low salinity environment and were then subsequently crossed using a North Carolina II breeding design. We measured body size and survival of the larvae raised under low or high salinity. We found that offspring had a larger body size when raised under high salinity, but were also larger under high salinity if one of their parents came from the low salinity environment. We hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms may explain the high plasticity of this species under stressful low salinity conditions, which is inherited by their offspring and increases fitness when exposed to optimal salinity conditions. Estimates of heritability for body size was also high for this population (~0.5), suggesting that this trait can evolve, but it is also heavily influenced by parental acclimation.

Previous experiments have shown that mussels raised in low pH seawater are typically smaller, have thinner and weaker shells, and exhibit poor physiological condition compared to those living under ambient conditions. In contrast, calcifying predatory crabs have exhibited mixed responses – negative, neutral, or positive – depending upon the species and life stage considered. If crabs get larger and stronger as mussels become smaller and weaker, the predator-prey relationship between the two taxa could be dramatically altered against mussels. We have developed a mechanistic model parameterized with data from the field and lab to predict effects of OA and crab predation on mussel population growth and persistence. Mussel population fitness, as a function of projected reproductive output, can then be compared among models representing different combinations of OA and predation risk. We evaluated the effects of changes in mussel shell thickness and growth rate, and changes in crab carapace size, claw strength, and feeding and foraging behavior on mussel population performance. Scenarios with the greatest negative impact involved limitations on the ability of mussels to reach a predation-resistant size – specifically, decreases in mussel growth rate and/or increases in crab size.

For coastal reserves, effectiveness is determined by the extent the reserves offshore limits encompass the offshore movements of the protected species. Within an effective reserve’s boundaries, abundance and mean sizes of the protected species will increase towards the reserve’s centre as probability of fishing mortality decreases. Monitoring of rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) in two small north-eastern New Zealand marine reserves has identified substantial declines over the last 10 years. These declines are believed to be driven by the capture of lobster moving across offshore reserve boundaries. To understand the extent these declines are related to reserve size, lobster populations were surveyed across both reserves and in adjacent non-protected areas using commercial lobster-pots. Spatial analysis revealed little difference in CPUE and mean size between reserve centres and potting stations close to longshore boundaries. Overall, CPUE was 3.5 (±0.3) and 3.4 (±0.4) kg within the reserves, and only 0.1 (±0.03) kg in non-protected areas.

As microplastics (MP, plastic < 5mm) become more prevalent in our waters, it is important examine how MP affects key ecosystem processes, such as benthic-pelagic coupling by suspension-feeders. We focused on mussels (Mytilus spp.), well-known suspension-feeder and bioindicator species, and how the sinking and resuspension rates of their biodeposits are affected by a diet that includes MP. Mussels are known to ingest MP both in natural and laboratory settings around the world but it remains unclear whether MP affects the biophysical characteristics of biodeposits. Due to the size and buoyancy of MP in seawater, we hypothesized mussel biodeposits containing MP sink at a slower rate and are more easily resuspended into the water column than biodeposits without MP. Preliminary results demonstrate biodeposits containing MP are larger and sink at a slower rate than biodeposits that do not contain MP. Further, mussels fed high quantities of MP produce larger and slower sinking biodeposits than those fed low quantities of MP. These findings suggest that mussels can effectively clear MP from the water column, but the biodeposits they produce can concentrate MP and re-introduce the pollutant into the water-column in the form of a more bio-available package.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harris, L.",University of Washington,University of Washington,"Carrington, E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),THE EFFECT OF MICROPLASTIC ON MUSSEL BIODEPOSIT SINKING AND RESUSPENSION,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Eradication programs can fall victim to overcompensation, which is the paradoxical model result that under certain conditions, harvest can result in greater equilibrium population size relative to unharvested levels. While overcompensation has been well studied in most systems, no have involved invasive species or marine systems. Following five years of intensive eradication efforts, we documented a dramatic population explosion of the invasive European green crab (*Carcinus maenas*) in an isolated California estuary. After a >90% removal of the adult population from 2009-2013, we recorded a 30-fold increase in population size in 2014 relative to 2013. Populations in four surrounding bays monitored over the same five-year period did not experience the same increase in 2014. This indicates this was not caused by regional oceanography but was due to overcompensation. Substantial isolation of this population, demonstrated by molecular data, also suggests that the increase was due to internal population dynamics and not to outside recruitment. In mesocosm experiments, we demonstrated adult control of recruitment, via size dependent cannibalism; this control was subsequently lost during the eradication, creating the dramatic recruitment.

Individual specialization is expected to increase in predictable environments as greater individual-level foraging efficiency can increase fitness and decrease intraspecific competition. In contrast, unpredictability should promote generalist diets as these can confer fitness advantages in times of resource scarcity. These predictions remain largely untested, but are subject to assumptions regarding a generalist’s diet plasticity via learning and heritability. Here, we use manipulative laboratory experiments to quantify the relative contributions of learning and heritable diet plasticity in shaping individual specialization in the hatchlings of six populations of *Nucella ostrina* across a gradient of environmental predictability. Preliminary analyses suggest that, regardless of the predictability of an individual’s source location, prior foraging on mussels decreases subsequent foraging time on mussels compared to naïve individuals. However, whelks from sites with more predictable prey showed a ~10% decrease in handling times, suggesting increased efficiency in handling mussels regardless of prior experience.

Species introduced from distant locations (non-native species) have many well-studied impacts on ecosystems, such as predation on or competition with native species or habitat modification. Range-expanding species (species with expanded ranges contiguous to native ranges), have the potential to be similarly impactful, but are less well-studied, or even considered beneficial as ecosystems adapt to climate change. In this study, we compared range-expander impacts on populations of interacting species to a comparable subset of introduced species.

We are testing the hypothesis that artificial coral heads with many shelter holes will enhance the local abundance of herbivorous fishes and urchins, eventually resulting in lower cover of benthic algae, and thereby enhancing the recruitment, survival, and growth of corals.  We are monitoring 12 cubic-meter concrete modules (half with many holes, half with no holes) off the south coast of the island of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i, half located near a severely degraded reef, and half located in the oldest fully protected marine reserve in the state.  Results during the first two years of this 10-year experiment indicate that the relative health of the local reefscape is more important than shelter availability per se in determining benthic succession on these modules.  Coral recruitment was initially greater were herbivores were less abundant, perhaps because where urchins were common they dislodged newly settled coral larvae as they overgrazed benthic algae.  However, subsequent coral growth was correlated with higher abundances of herbivores as algal overgrowth inhibited surviving coral colonies where herbivores were rare.  These initial results are consistent with the idea that coral restoration must occur hand-in-hand with herbivore enhancement for effective conservation of coral reefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hixon, M.H.",University of Hawaii,University of Hawaii,"Dilley, E.R.",University of Hawaii,"Brush, E.G.",University of Hawaii,"Jones, R.N.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,CReME: CORAL RESILIENCE MODULE EXPERIMENT,,Invitee,

We review and compare the processes used by federal governments for making place-based management decisions in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and assess if and how these processes account for multiple-stressors. We find that, despite a wide range in terminology used, the decision-making processes in each country are very similar, especially between Canada and the U.S., and are based loosely around an Open Standards framework. The key stages identified in which managers can account for multiple stressors lie in (1) defining the system, including inviting diverse stakeholder and agency involvement, and (2) quantifying linkages among stressors and targets in the system. To illustrate the importance of the latter, we construct Bayesian Belief Networks of a hypothetical kelp forest to assess the consequences of management decisions when cumulative and non-linear effects are overlooked or incorporated.

Since many of these stressors (temperature, O~2~) are strong drivers of metabolic rate, we hypothesized that sessile conspecifics residing in different tidal zones would exhibit distinct ‘metabolic phenotypes,’ a term we use to describe an organisms’ baseline metabolic characteristics and capacity. To investigate this, we collected acorn barnacles (*Balanus glandula*) from low, mid and high intertidal positions and measured biochemical ([lactate], lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and citrate synthase (CS) activity), physiological (MO~2~, body size), and behavioral (cirri beat frequency, time active) indices of metabolism. We found that low intertidal barnacles had a greater capacity for anaerobic metabolism (increased LDH activity), fed less when submerged, and consequently, were smaller in size compared to those in the high intertidal. We observed no lactate accumulation in barnacles from any tidal height following 24h air exposure, which suggests that the enhanced anaerobic capacity of low intertidal barnacles is not a response to acute emersion. Finally, there was no effect of tidal position on CS activity or MO~2~ (in air or seawater), implying that aerobic capacity may not be as sensitive to tidal position as anaerobic processes. How individuals differ in metabolic capacity is interesting in the context of climate change, as the intertidal is predicted to experience greater extremes in abiotic stressors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Horn, K.M.",California Polytechnic State University,California Polytechnic State University,"Cyr, A.",California Polytechnic State University,"Handley, A.L.",California Polytechnic State University,"Liautaud, K.A.",California Polytechnic State University,"Morton, L.N.",Cornell University,"Fournet, M.E.H.",Sonoma State University,"Zippay, M.L.",California Polytechnic State University,"Hardy, K.M.",,,8,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,"EFFECT OF TIDAL POSITION ON METABOLIC PHENOTYPE IN COMMON ACORN BARNACLE, BALANUS GLANDULA","Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Crustose coralline algae (CCA), such as *Porolithon onkodes*, are important structural calcifying components on coral reefs and they grow across a range of depths. The current study aimed to quantify the impacts of OA on this foundational reef-building species through measuring photosynthesis. This was done by investigating the interactive effects of light quantity, spectral quality and pCO~2~ on *P. onkodes* to determine if CCA are impacted differentially by OA at depth. CCA samples were placed in mesocosms fitted with distinct and previously measured light filters, using both a PAR sensor and spectrometer, which were utilized to simulate the light characteristics that occur at shallow (2 m) and deeper (17 m) reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia in both ambient (400 uatm) and elevated (1000 uatm) pCO~2~ treatments.  Photosynthetic performance was determined by the relative rate of electron transport, measured weekly using Pulse Amplitude Fluorometry (PAM), and compared to the rates of oxygen evolution in incubation chambers from a previous 32 day experiment. Results suggest that the rate of photosynthesis in OA conditions in high light environments is relatively unchanged and the difference in photosynthesis is significantly less in lower light environments at elevated pCO~2~ levels when compared to ambient.

Ancient DNA reveals that *C. lawi* diverged from dabbling ducks in the Miocene indicating the substantial lineage histories lost as human populations expanded.  Despite *C. lawi*’s ancient connection to dabbling ducks, nitrogen isotopes indicate that it was an invertivore with a diet more extreme than modern king-eider and that overlaps with sea otters.  Otters became more abundant in the archaeological record once the competing duck was gone, and abalone become substantially smaller suggesting reorganization in the trophic ecology involving direct effects of anthropogenic predation on abalone and *C. lawi*, but also indirect effects associated with increased otter populations through the loss of this competing large invertivore and an enhanced impact on abalone via otter.

Meso-predator choice between starved and gravid sea urchins in barren and kelp forest habitats,"Prey condition (e.g., young, old, sick, starved) and quality (e.g., caloric content) are important drivers of predator-prey interactions. While prey preferences have been widely documented in top predators, less is known about how prey quality influences selection by mid-trophic level predators. Along the central coast of California, active sea urchin grazing has shifted extensive kelp forests to patchy “barren” areas. In patches of forest, sea urchins are healthy (i.e., gravid) and invest energy into gonad production, while those in patches of barrens are starved and lack fully developed gonads. In this study, we examined if two meso-predators commonly found in kelp forests (red rock crab, leather sea star) preferentially target gravid sea urchins over those that are starved. Predators were given a choice between a gravid urchin and a non-gravid urchin in a controlled laboratory seawater system and monitored via video surveillance. Videos were analyzed for three different interactions from the predator: touch, pass, and attack. Analysis on first attacks revealed leather stars have a preference for gravid urchins (p=0.0, AIC=98.4, DF=1), while red rock crab exhibited no preference. These results suggest that red rock crab may help reduce barren urchin population leading to the recovery of barren areas, while leather star will help strengthen the resiliency of kelp forest patches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jarman, C.N.","University of California, Santa Cruz","University of California, Santa Cruz","Smith, J.G.","University of California, Santa Cruz","Carr, M.H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,Guts or gonads?

Overfishing of spawning aggregations combined with poor population recruitment are hypothesized to have contributed to dramatic catch declines.  Catches remain at all-time lows, and there is uncertainty in whether the level of current allowable take is adequate for rebuilding the population.  Mortality estimates are lacking for this species, yet they are a key aspect of fish population assessment.  We used a uniquely long-term mark-recapture data set spanning several decades in a Barker mark-recapture model to estimate survival and derive fishery exploitation during each period.  After accounting for tag loss (mean = 15.8%, 95%CI = 10.2 - 21.3%), annual survival in the 1990s (mean = 16.0%, 95%CI = 7.9 - 25.9%) was lower and more variable than in the 1960s (mean = 36.6%, 95%CI = 31.2 - 41.9%) and more recently, in 2013 (mean = 27.7, 95%CI = 22.4 – 33.1%).

One consequence of increased nutrient levels is proliferation of macroalgae. We investigated spatial and temporal dynamics of ephemeral macroalgal mats and their effects on salt marsh in a eutrophic estuary in central California. An 80-year time series analysis revealed that algal wrack on salt marsh increased exponentially in frequency, and was highly correlated with nutrient concentrations in the estuary, which have increased along with fertilizer use. Analysis of sediment δ^15^N showed a dramatic increase in nutrient loads attributable to agricultural fertilizer over the past 50 years. We monitored 15 salt marsh plots along the bank edge and detected a negative relationship between algal wrack cover and salt marsh cover, flowering, and canopy height. Algal wrack also led to retreat of vegetation from the bank edge, and increased bank erosion. We experimentally added algal wrack to salt marsh edge plots. Algal addition decreased salt marsh cover, flowering, and canopy height, and increased retreat rate. By integrating time series analyses, isotope data, algal and marsh monitoring and manipulative experiments, we identified robust linkages between increased anthropogenic nutrient loading, increased algal wrack cover, reduction in marsh resilience and conversion of marsh habitat to mudflat through bank erosion.

Functional enrichment analysis showed low overlap between genes DE in response to thermal stress compared with hypoosmotic stress. Experiments also showed that at low salinity, oysters had significantly increased respiration rates at 30˚C. However, despite the higher energetic demands, oysters did not increase their feeding rate. To investigate transcriptional differences between populations *in situ*, we sampled oysters from three locations and two time points across the Louisiana coast and used quantitative PCR to measure the expression levels of seven target genes.

Evaluating niche partitioning in wild systems is difficult due to the complex nature of ecological niches. Ecotoxicological contaminant profiles accumulate across the life of individuals, providing a potential tool by which to assess niche partitioning in situ. Shortfin Mako, Blue, and Common Thresher Sharks comprise a predatory guild within the Southern California Bight, and thus likely partition spatial and dietary resources to limit competitive exclusion. Given that organic contaminants are acquired mainly through prey, a resource under potential competition, and vary geographically, they represent a potential useful ecological marker. We analyzed legacy organic contaminant profiles for 47 Mako, 22 Blue, and 51 Thresher Sharks to determine the degree of niche partitioning among these three species. Species could be distinguished based on total contaminant loads, as there was a 10-fold stepwise difference in total concentrations among them, and by their contaminant fingerprint, as random forest analysis found that species could be correctly classified with a 4% error rate.

As part of the Northern Line Islands in the Central Pacific, Palmyra Atoll is an ideal location to study global change in the absence of confounding local impacts (e.g., fishing and pollution) since it is remote, uninhabited, and federally-protected. Permanent photoquadrats were taken approximately annually at 8 sites around Palmyra from 2009-2018 on the fore reef (10m depth) and reef terrace (5m depth). Using image analysis, we quantify spatial and temporal changes in benthic community composition, focusing on coral and algal functional groups/genera/species as well as any other benthic taxa. Throughout this period, thermal stress-induced coral bleaching events occurred in 2009 and 2015. However, over the past decade this reef system has remained stable overall in terms of benthic cover, other than a slight deviation from stability shortly following the respective bleaching events. While the disturbances seemed to initially favor dominance by turf and other fleshy algae, within 1-2 years following the bleaching events, the percent cover of each benthic group-- including corals and crustose coralline algae, was generally similar to pre-bleaching levels.

Although prey state and density may mediate such interactions, few studies examine these contexts simultaneously. This omission is surprising given that prey state and density often co-vary across habitats (e.g. urchin barrens are dominated by high densities of starving urchins). Also, most studies manipulate prey state rather than comparing anti-predator responses of prey collected from habitats that vary naturally in prey state. We used mesocosms to compare the responses of purple sea urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) from either kelp forests or barrens to waterborne cues from lobster predators (*Panulirus interruptus*). When tested at ecologically relevant densities (low or high density, for kelp forests and barrens, respectively), urchins from forests, but not barrens, reduced kelp grazing by 72.7% when exposed to lobster cues. Interestingly, barren urchins failed to respond to lobster cues only in the presence of waterborne cues from high densities of conspecifics (i.e. when a quorum was detected). Isolated barren urchins starved for up to 64 days strongly reduced grazing in the presence of predation risk. Similar to microbes that dramatically change gene expression with density, we propose that urchins use quorum sensing to mediate responses to predators. Such behaviors should reduce the non-consumptive effects of lobsters on urchins in barrens, which could impair kelp recovery in deforested habitats, and may generally contribute to the persistence of alternative stable states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knight, C.J.",San Diego State University / Stanford University,San Diego State University,"Dunn, R.P.",San Diego State University,"Long, J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,"CONSPECIFIC CUES, NOT STARVATION, MEDIATE HABITAT-SPECIFIC RESPONSES OF URCHINS TO PREDATION RISK","Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

We designed a low-cost, thermal manipulation system to effectively alter tide pool temperatures in the field. We heated and cooled natural pools in situ to demonstrate the magnitude of temperature change that can be achieved using the system and evaluated changes in abiotic parameters (salinity, DO, pH). With warming, we found that temperature and salinity were significantly higher in heated than control pools and with cooling temperature and salinity remained significantly higher in control pools. We then simulated a heatwave in artificial tide pools, increasing temperature by 4°C for six days during low-tide, to understand; 1) how heatwaves may impact community structure, and 2) whether impacts depend on the dominant species present. Following heating, we measured tide pool clearance rates, production, respiration, and species abundances. We found that the dominant species present had a significant effect on community performance metrics and composition. With heating, we found that there were no differences in whole community performance metrics, however composition was altered, and we saw significant changes in species abundance",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Konecny, C.A.",The University of British Columbia,The University of British Columbia,"Brownlee, G.R.P.",The University of British Columbia,"Harley, C.D.G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,TO FRY OR TO SAUTÉ: INNOVATION IN TIDE POOL THERMAL MANIPULATION,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

We estimated municipio-specific mangrove carbon stocks averaging 519.3 Mg C ha-1 and an average annual gross deforestation rate of 1.15%. The current rate of deforestation will result in a social cost of 3 thousand million US$ over the next 25 years.

However, recovery has been markedly stratified by depth, with coral cover inversely related to depth, despite similar levels of coral recruitment at 10m and 17m. Here, we tested the independent and interactive effects of depth and coral predation as mechanisms contributing to patterns in coral abundance and distribution across depths. To do so, we coupled MCR LTER time series data, observational surveys, and reciprocal transplant experiments using *Acropora retusa* and *A. hyacinthus*, the two most common Acroporid coral species on the fore reef of Moorea. We found contrasting, taxa-specific patterns in abundance, growth rates, and predation that varied with depth. By 2018, *A. retusa* was most abundant at 10m and 17m, while *A. hyancinthus* colonies were most abundant at 5m and decreased in density and size with depth. Experimental colonies of *A. retusa* were not influenced by corallivory at any depth but grew slower when artificially wounded, suggesting limited ability to cope with predation. In contrast, corallivory reduced growth rates of exposed *A. hyacinthus* colonies at 5m and 10m depth but had no effect on growth rates at 17m. These findings suggest that corallivory is likely an important biological force driving the distribution and growth of these important corals on Pacific reefs, but that the impact of coral predation varies by coral species and is mediated by depth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"LADD, M.C.",University of California Santa Barbara,University of California Santa Barbara,"Winslow, E.",University of California Santa Barbara,"Burkepile, D.E.",University of California Santa Barbara,"Lenihan, H.S.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF DEPTH AND PREDATION ON THE DISTRIBUTION, SIZE, AND GROWTH OF ACROPORA RETUSA AND ACROPORA HYACINTHUS","No, I would not like my work to be judged/am not presenting",Invitee,

We used this marker to detect white shark DNA in 250 ml water samples taken from across two sites in Santa Barbara, California (United States) frequented by juvenile white sharks. We did not detect white shark DNA in samples from two neighboring sites where sharks are presumably absent, suggesting that eDNA can indicate nearby white sharks. This marker development, testing, and opportunistic application in a region with known distributions of white sharks indicates that eDNA could be developed further to monitor white sharks, thereby informing conservation planning and public safety.

Based on increasing concern over the long term stability of bottom fish populations in the region by both state and federal agencies, the aquarium formalized monitoring in 2005 with diver based video surveys to monitor bottom fish diversity and abundance over time. Divers performed 100 m video transects devised to be non-invasive and repeatable for assessing diurnally active bottom fishes over time. Transects were conducted in August from 2005-2019 in The Strait of Juan de Fuca with Puget Sound sites surveyed seasonally since 2009. Species were qualified and quantified by biologists counting fish off of the archived video. Over fifteen years there was an increase in diversity of sessile adult rockfish and a decrease in density of adult schooling rockfish such as blacks and blues at sites in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, while since 2009, the opposite was true in many sites in Puget Sound. There were several significant young of the year (YOY) rockfish recruitment “jackpot recruitment” events documented in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

For nearly 200 years, ocean ecosystems in Gwaii Haanas have been out of balance. With loss of sea otters that are voracious shellfish predators, macroinvertebrates became larger and much more abundant. Kelp forests today are greatly diminished in abundance, depth and area due to intense grazing by hyperabundant urchins freed from top-down control. Degraded kelp forests negatively impact marine ecosystems, species at risk, and culturally important species by reducing habitat, primary productivity and coastal protection. The Haida Nation and Canada are collaborating to restore kelp forests over a 3-km long restoration site. Working with fishing industry partners, we mimicked sea otter predation by removing and cracking >75% of the urchins at the site, providing traditional foods, guuding.ngaay (red urchin) and styuu (green urchin), to Haida communities. With researchers, we are leveraging restoration efforts to better understand how urchin removals cause dynamic change in rocky reef ecosystem components and population dynamics, using a before-after control-impact design.

The main classes contributing to the dissimilarity between reef zones were Chlamydiia, Deinococci and Flavobacteriia. The microbial network in the outer coral microbiome was more tightly connected compared with the inner coral microbiome. The metagenomes of the coral mucus microbiome provided data for the model development and validation, by comparing the predicted relative abundances to the observed relative abundances. The model accurately predicted the microbiome of *P. strigosa*. To investigate the drivers of the coral-microbial community dynamics from each reef zone, the model was applied to six scenarios that combined different profiles of temperature and microbial network.

Such small islands typically receive more subsidies because of a higher shoreline:area ratio and because they harbor greater densities of nesting seabirds. Also, humans or human-introduced vertebrates have often reduced seabird populations below historic levels on large islands (>1.0 km^2). However, subsidies could be increasingly important on large islands where restoration efforts have increased nesting seabird densities by removing non-native predators and preventing egg poaching. We compared the stable isotope signatures from the same seven plant species and three animal taxa from South Coronado Island (SCI, a relatively large island with abundant seabirds) and Cabrillo National Monument (CNM, a low seabird site). Tissues from SCI were isotopically heavier than tissues from CNM for 6 plant species reliant on soil nitrogen, but not the legume. Beetle and rattlesnake tissues from SCI were also isotopically heavier. Further, the isotope signatures from SCI tissues matched those from much smaller islands in the Gulf of California. Thus, marine subsidies influence this large island.

However, whether similar declines have occurred in northern California is largely unknown. Using an unpublished student project conducted with Dr. S.F. Light in 1941, we tested whether species diversity in mussel beds at Dillon Beach has declined over the past 78 years. We located and re-surveyed the same large plot from the original 1941 report, as well as 3 replicate plots, to tease apart temporal versus spatial variation in community richness and diversity. We found a diverse assemblage of mussel bed fauna including >90 invertebrate species. In contrast to prior studies from southern California, there was no evidence of a decline in species richness and diversity. A few of the observed changes in abundance and composition might reflect shifts in geographic ranges. Only one species found in the 1941 study was entirely absent from our 2019 survey. However, the sea cucumber (*Cucumaria pseudocurata*) disappeared from the region recently, during a harmful algal bloom in 2011. Spatial variation in abundance among the replicate plots was relatively high, particularly for highly mobile or brooding species. The stability of species diversity over time is a positive sign for the health of these mussel bed communities. As of now, it appears that extreme climatic events and mass mortality events, rather than long-term warming trends, may have greater effects on mussel bed communities in northern California.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Longman, E.K","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Merolla, S.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Sanford, E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),USING HISTORICAL DATA TO TEST WHETHER SPECIES DIVERSITY HAS DECLINED IN MUSSEL BED COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Are these persistent climatological phenomena or two sides of the same ecological coin? A driving hypothesis in marine ecology is that ocean acidification is a uniform, global response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This hypothesis has been supported by data from open ocean habitats – where seawater pH remains static on short time scales and largely responds to long-term changes in air-sea gas equilibrium. Observations in coastal habitats have not supported this hypothesis, and singular phenomena have been applied to correct for the difference (e.g. upwelling, river input, eutrophication). I tested an alternative hypothesis that seawater pH is a dynamic response to multiple factors acting at local scales, including the balance of photosynthesis and respiration. Using research from the Salish Sea and a cross-system experiment in seagrass and adjacent nearshore habitats, I show that incorporating local biological processes was essential to describe pH variation at scales ranging from minutes to decades, and individual to ecosystem scales. The biological effects were mediated by physical factors leading to dramatic, yet ecologically predictable, spatial and temporal patterns of pH variation. Community metabolism led to a wide range of pH, including extreme highs and lows, highlighting the dynamic nature of seawater pH in coastal habitats.

Although there has been fisheries protections for this species in MX since 2007 and the establishment of fishing bans in 2012 (MX), 1994 (California), and 2005 (US waters), there are different levels of fishing-related mortality of juvenile White Sharks between the US and Mexico.  Despite these levels of fishing mortality, there is evidence of White Shark population increase, which is likely promoted by recovery of adult prey (e.g., seals, sea lions, whales) and points toward the success of environmental protection measures.

The total abundance of meroplankton inside the kelp forest was more than one order of magnitude higher than outside. Taxonomic richness inside the kelp forest was also greater, with 54 taxa found inside compared to 28 taxa outside. Copepods and cyphonaute Membranipora spp. larvae were the main groups found at both sites, although their abundance and vertical distribution patterns during the development of the internal tide were opposite at the two sites. Both of these groups showed significantly greater abundance in the bottom strata during the cold phase of the internal tide outside of the kelp forest, however, within the kelp forest, the abundance of Membranipora spp. significantly increased in the surface strata. We propose that this might be due to the behavior of these bryozoan larvae in order to reach their near surface settlement habitat in the canopy, potentially combined with the effect of the physical structure of the kelp fronds causing shoaling, resulting in organisms found in the bottom strata offshore to be advected into the shallows inside the kelp forest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maldonado, A.A.",C.I.C.E.S.E.

To fight back managers have explored several control strategies such as fishing tournaments (derbies) and establishing commercial fisheries. Concerns exist that the goal of a lionfish fishery might morph from conservation to purely economic benefits. We analyzed the characteristics and impacts of an incipient fishery aimed to control invasive lionfish in the Mexican Caribbean. We analyzed official lionfish landings, lionfish derbies data, and lionfish densities from locations at the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. We found that lionfish is captured across the coast but landings in Cozumel alone are comparable to or higher than numbers of lionfish captured in derbies across the wider Caribbean region. Survey data suggests a reduction (~ 60%) in lionfish density on Cozumel reefs from 2013 onward. Exploiting a new species with little regulation and comparable landed value to other harvested fish species (e.g., grouper) is a welcome opportunity to local communities. However, there is a challenge to maintaining market interest and keeping the fishery’s momentum going to make it financially sustainable. Results suggest that this incipient fishery was only viable and yielded the observed benefits by being developed within an established fishery.

Current management practices in the Baja fisheries include seasonal closure, effort control and the return of captured lobsters under a minimum legal size. These management practices have lead to relative success in the fishery, however, there is a high rate of sublegal bycatch, and a large amount of variance in catch success rate between fishing sites, and fishing teams. In this study we aimed to understand the composition of the lobster population effected by the fishery, looking at size and sex breakdown of the individuals caught through on board observations of catch of 16 different fishing teams. In addition, we hoped to understand the variance of this catch from both the perspective of the lobster caught by location, and the success and effort by fishing teams. We found that there is a consistent rate of bycatch of sublegal individuals throughout the season, in addition to a high rate of female catch.

Overharvest led to the closure of the commercial fishery in 1947, while recreational harvest is still permitted today. However, Pismo clam populations have continued to decline throughout the state of California despite numerous management actions. We designed a study to examine the relationship between Pismo clam abundance and a variety of abiotic and biotic factors. This study will improve our understanding of this socioeconomically important species and inform Pismo clam management within California.

We quantified Pismo clam presence and abundance at 38 sites across their range in California from Monterey Bay, CA to the US-Mexico border during 2018 and 2019. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship of biotic and abiotic factors, such as predator presence, human population density and sediment characteristics, on clam presence and abundance using a mixed model framework. Our results suggest that local sediment characteristics are an important predictor of Pismo clam presence. However, it is likely that several factors interact to influence clam abundance. Additional analyses will further examine the interactions among biotic, anthropogenic, and habitat parameters to help us better understand the ecology and potential recovery of Pismo clam populations in California.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marquardt, A.R.",California Polytechnic State University,California Polytechnic State University,"Park, S.K.",California Polytechnic State University,"Clark, N.M.",California Polytechnic State University,"Maietta, E.G.",California Polytechnic State University,"De Luca, E.M.",California Polytechnic State University,"Almaguer, D.E.",California Polytechnic State University,"Waltz, G.T.",California Polytechnic State University,"Ruttenberg, B.I.",,,8,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,"DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, AND HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS OF PISMO CLAMS, *Tivela stultorum*, IN CALFORNIA","Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Current research employs methods to estimate either occupancy (presence-absence) or abundance (density or biomass) of a species within an area. This study shows how these two approaches can be combined to simultaneously estimate occurrence and abundance by specifying an incomplete-detection zero-inflated distribution. This modeling approach is particularly useful when the patterns of occurrence and abundance stem from different processes. In most instances, species’ detection data are pooled, and any ontogenetic patterns of distribution are lost. By modeling distinct age classes separately, we see there are significant differences in habitat associations between young-of-the-year, sexually immature adolescents, and reproductive adult members of three commonly-occurring rockfish species along California’s central coast. Additionally, there is evidence of adaptive habitat usage between locations that differ in physical composition, suggesting it may be incorrect to assume there is a “one-size-fits-all” model when predicting rockfish distributions across a large geographic range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Martel, G.R.",Humboldt State Univerisity,Humboldt State University,"Tissot, B.N.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,MULTIVARIATE HABITAT-BASED PREDICTIVE MODELING OF THREE DEMERSAL ROCKFISH SPECIES ALONG THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Thus, methods to efficiently and accurately assess structural complexity are relevant for coral reef monitoring and conservation. Using Structure from Motion (SfM), it is now possible to quantify the structural complexity of coral reefs using interactive 3D models. This study uses SfM to quantify linear rugosity, the ratio of contour distance to horizontal distance across the reef surface, across spatial scales at reefs in the Main and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (MHI and NWHI). Cross-scale patterns of rugosity differed among reef types: coral-dominated reefs exhibited the highest structural complexity at small scales (mm to cm), while reefs with large variations in substrate topography (due to ridges, canyons, boulders, or other geologic features) exhibited more structural complexity at large scales (cm to m). Degraded reefs were characterized by low rugosity across all spatial scales. Using these methods, cross-scale differences in rugosity between the MHI and NWHI were attributed to higher coral cover at sites surveyed in the MHI rather than differences in underlying reef topography between regions. This study demonstrates how traditional methods of assessing reef condition can be scaled up to yield new insights using SfM. The ability to rapidly measure rugosity across scales using SfM can improve our ability to identify aspects of the reef (biotic vs. geologic) that drive structural complexity and contextualize change in complexity over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McCarthy, O.

Understanding inherent spatio-temporal variability within corals, and their associated symbionts, is fundamental to our ability to quantify resilience and observe potential tipping points within coral reef socio-ecological systems. We tracked microbiome variability across nested spatial scales of island side, reef habitat, sites, and within 3 host species during two seasons around the island of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Water, sediment and three coral species' microbiomes were distinct from each other although all shared taxa. There were also spatial and temporal patterns within each of the different microbiome types, although factors, especially season, did not always result in a different microbial community associated within each group. The bacterial family *Endozoicamonaceae*, associated with carbon cycling, represented 75% of coral microbiomes and was the most deterministic in distinguishing groups. The remaining 25% of coral microbiome sequence abundance represented the vast majority (99%) of richness. Resampled coral colonies showed within-site variance, and clear spatial heterogeneity supported that sites are deterministic of microbiomes.

Despite the expected high consumption rates and possible large impact in driving seaweed community composition in local waters, little work has been conducted to measure their feeding rates. Therefore, the first goal of my study was to measure and compare the feeding rates of *A. vaccaria* when offered eight brown seaweeds common in the herbivore’s habit. As documented in studies with other, often smaller, herbivores, consumption rates and seaweed diet selectivity may be driven by characteristics that vary among algal species, such as chemical defenses (phlorotannins) and nutritional content (C:N). The second goal of this study was to elucidate the potential role of seaweed chemical composition in driving the relative feeding rates of *A. vaccaria*, focusing on phlorotannin concentrations and C:N. Consumption rates by A. vaccaria on eight common brown seaweeds were relatively similar among taxa, suggesting that the herbivore is an indiscriminate, generalist consumer. Feeding rates did not appear to be extensively driven by either seaweed traits. Although total consumption by *A. vaccaria* was markedly higher than that of other common herbivores in the region, the feeding rate standardized by biomass of herbivores was relatively similar among herbivore taxa, suggesting that *A. vaccaria* is not as voracious as originally believed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McHaskell, D.A.","Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","Smith, J.R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,"BLACK HARE MAGIC: FEEDING RATES OF A LARGE SEA HARE, APLYSIA VACCARIA, ON BROWN ALGAE AND EXPLORATION OF POTENTIAL DRIVERS","Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

In kelp forest ecosystems, the direct interactions between an apex predator, herbivore, and algae can lead to indirect effects on inshore fish populations due to the loss of viable habitat, food, and protection previously provided by algae, and the temperate rocky reef itself. In 2013, Northern California experienced significant loss of an apex predator, the sunflower star. Simultaneously, we observed an increase in purple urchin densities, which caused a decline in bull kelp, understory algae and red abalone densities. According to data collected by Reef Check community scientists, fish populations in this region have declined by roughly 70% since 2016. Undergoing this decline are ecologically and economically important species such as lingcod (74% decrease), cabezon (80% decrease), and kelp greenling (75% decrease). Prior to the decline, an increase in fish populations was observed from 2014-2016. It is possible that observed fish populations had returned to 2014 levels after an unexplained increase; however, it is also possible that the 2014-2016 trend did not represent an actual increase, but was an artifact of the sampling technique and/or changes to animal behavior following the phase shift. This is similar to an observation in 2014 with red abalone density and behavioral changes. Nonetheless, the decrease since 2016 is feared to represent an actual decline in fish populations due to the phase shift from kelp forest to urchin barren states.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McHugh, T.A.",Reef Check Foundation,Reef Check Foundation,"Abbott, D.",Reef Check Foundation,"McMillian, S.",Reef Check Foundation,"Freiwald, J.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REEFS EXPERIENCING PHASE SHIFT FROM KELP FOREST TO URCHIN BARREN,,Invitee,

This may be exacerbated in the intertidal zone, one of the most thermally dynamic places on earth, where tides expose organisms to extreme temperatures. Not all intertidal organisms will experience the same risk: in northern regions of the US, summertime low tides occur during warm middays, in contrast to cooler pre-dawn tides in southern regions. Some organisms may be able to behaviorally thermoregulate to avoid exposure to thermal extremes. We compared thermoregulation efficiency of gumboot chitons (*Cryptochiton stelleri*), a thermally-sensitive species, from thermally-stressful sites on San Juan Island, WA (SJI) and in more thermally-benign sites in northern California (CA) with three components: 1) biomimetic models (roboboots) deployed in the intertidal zone at four sites in CA and four sites on SJI; 2) chiton thermal preference in a laboratory-based thermal gradient; and 3) chiton body temperatures at field sites where roboboots were deployed. We found that CA chitons encountered extreme temperatures less frequently but expressed some thermoregulative activity compared to SJI chitons, which experienced thermal extremes more often but avoided thermally favorable habitat, possibly to increase access food or to reduce the probability of exposure to thermal extremes. These results suggest that chitons in northern regions of the US may be particularly susceptible to warming and extreme temperatures brought about by climate change compared to those in more southern regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McIntire, L.M.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State Univserity,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,CAN’T STAND THE HEAT?

LTEES provide data needed to investigate changes to ecosystems over time. However, protocols developed initially may need to be altered or updated as ocean conditions change, stressors shift, or management strategies are adapted. For example, new species may appear due to range expansions or invasions, specific areas may become important to be monitored (i.e. newly established Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)), or a more realistic representation of a changing ecosystem might be needed. The Reef Check California (RCCA) citizen science program has been collecting ecological data on the rocky reefs of California since 2006. Initially, RCCA developed a monitoring protocol to address existing management questions. In recent years, however, many of California’s reefs have experienced dramatic changes, including phase shifts from kelp forests to urchin barrens, transitions from endemic to invasive algae, and appearances (and in some cases establishments) of more tropical invertebrate and fish species. Over time, RCCA has adjusted their monitoring protocols to capture these developments, without compromising the existing data set. Recent data (especially from Southern California) have demonstrated the importance of adapting LTEES monitoring protocols to ensure that ongoing changes  to ecosystems are identified and recorded.

Each pathway is associated with benefits and risks but SSFs often have limited access to the knowledge and resources needed for effective decision-making. Field research on the coupled social-ecological SSF systems of Baja California, Mexico, is addressing the overarching question of what processes and conditions promote resilience and adaptive capacity of coastal social-ecological systems. Results indicate a complex landscape of winners and losers among species and fisheries exposed to environmental variability, including heat waves, harmful algal blooms and extreme hypoxia, and that a suite of adaptive actions by the local fishing cooperative have helped confront these rapid and drastic changes.

Within aggregations such as mussel beds, a mosaic of environmental conditions can develop, and the resulting variation could drastically alter the performance of neighboring individuals. Using sensors mounted to *Mytilus californianus* mussels over two summers, we characterized temperature and valve gaping variation found at two spatial scales: within a group separated by centimeters, and between groups located at the upper and lower extents of the mussel zone. While temperature conditions near the lower edge of the mussel bed were generally more benign, temperature extremes were similar at both heights in the bed, and variation in body temperature among neighbors increased as the daily mean temperature rose. Gaping behavior was highly variable among individuals, though variability diminished at the high end of the mussel bed where submergence time was constrained. These data indicate that an individual’s physiological status and past history can be drastically different than those of nearby neighbors, complicating our ability to characterize representative conditions within a habitat. This also provides for the possibility that the impacts of future climate change will be highly specific to certain individuals based on their relative exposure within the mosaic.

Kelp forests are famous for strong trophic interactions, and are physically and biologically distinct from ecosystems where parasites have been thoroughly studied. Our objective was to build a high-resolution topological kelp forest food web that includes parasites.  We defined the study system as rocky reef that supports giant kelp in the Santa Barbara Channel, CA. Three trophic sub webs (predator-prey, parasite-host, and predator-parasite) were constructed using information from primary and grey literature, direct sampling (dissections), expert opinion, and logical inference. Resolving free-living species and their parasites increased the number of nodes in the web by nearly 5 fold relative to previously published webs. Inclusion of parasites affected food web metrics, with strong effects of concomitant predation. Maximum trophic level and food chain lengths increased via both improved resolution of mid-trophic levels and the addition of parasites feeding on top predators.  Larval stages of shark and bird parasites were prevalent and abundant in fishes, highlighting the importance of transient predators.

We experimentally investigated the relative importance of upwelling (influx of cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface) and consumer effects on benthic communities in the Galapagos subtidal. We measured macroalgal and sessile invertebrate abundance, diversity, biomass, and multivariate community structure in response to variation in upwelling strength and exposure to consumers through the deployment of 6-month recruitment plates. We found a negative relationship between species richness and upwelling strength in the form of an average reduction of 5 species per 2 degrees C decrease in temperature. Stronger upwelling also reduced multivariate dispersion, indicating a reduction in community variation. These two results suggest dominance by few benthic species when nutrients are plentiful and temperature is low. In a second set of experiments, consumption reduced invertebrate diversity and reduced multivariate community dispersion, but only in zones of low upwelling, suggesting that nutrient addition by upwelling may result in a bottom up effect that overrides consumption in structuring communities. As ocean temperature regimes are expected to change drastically over the next century, using the wide natural range of physical variables available in the Galapagos subtidal may help predict the response of benthic communities to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Munson, C.J.",Brown University,Brown University,"Lamb, R.W.",Brown University,"Greenhill, M.",Brown University,"Witman, J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,THE COUPLED EFFECTS OF UPWELLING AND PREDATION ON BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE GALAPAGOS SUBTIDAL,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

However, marine macrophytes like kelp can uptake CO~2~ via photosynthesis, reducing nearby ocean acidity, and thus have the potential to buffer calcifying organisms from OA stress. Recently, it has been shown that persistent, large kelp forests have large impacts on the local carbon cycle. On the California coast, historically large kelp forests have been reduced to smaller fragments, raising the question of whether these small fragments are able to mitigate OA to the same degree as large forests. To address this question, we captured spatial and temporal variability in seawater chemistry in multiple habitats within, in close proximity to, and outside recently fragmented bull kelp (*Nereocystis luetkeana*) forests on the north coast of California. Within fragmented *Nereocystis* forests, canopies increased pH, dissolved oxygen, and aragonite/calcite saturation levels relative to forest bottoms and nearby urchin barrens, and to a similar degree as large kelp forests. Our results therefore indicate that even small, fragmented kelp forests can provide potential refuge from OA stress for calcifying invertebrates and that kelp density, rather than area, may play a larger role in a forest’s ability to buffer OA than previously noted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Murie, K.A.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,"KELP HELP: FRAGMENTED NEREOCYSTIS LUETKEANA FORESTS ALTER SEAWATER CHEMISTRY, MITIGATING OCEAN ACIDIFICATION","Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Even small increases in the concentrations of compounds such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can have drastic impacts on ecosystem health and community composition. N and P concentrations in nearshore ecosystems can vary by orders of magnitude on very small temporal (hours) and spatial (meters) scales. Therefore, to fully understand the cycling, fate and impacts of chemical compounds in the marine environment, it is critical to sample at the temporal and spatial scales at which they fluctuate. The two most common methods used to collect water chemistry data, spot sampling and in-situ analyzers, are severely limited in their spatial and/or temporal resolution. Increasing the resolution of these methods requires a sizeable monetary or labor investment. In response, we developed a low-cost (~$250), open-source water sampling system that is compact, waterproof to diver-depth, and relatively easy to construct with tools available on most college campuses. In the base configuration, the sampler provides an integrated picture of water chemistry over the deployment period (up to 24 hours). The sampler’s design is easily modifiable to accommodate deeper and longer deployments, or to collect a time-series. We are currently using these samplers to collect data on organism derived nutrients that would otherwise be impossible due to the disturbance caused by the presence of divers.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between relative abundance of *M. birostris* with sea surface temperature (sst) and chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) in three islands of the park. Visual censuses were carry out during the cruise season from 2015 to 2018. The relative abundance of mantas was determined by the total number of organisms observed among the total number of dives conducted each month. The oceanographic parameters were downloaded from NASA's MODIS-AQUA sensor. According to the data obtained, there are significant differences between the abundance of mantas per island. San Benedicto was the island with the highest average value of relative abundance (2.1 mantas/diving), followed by Roca Partida (1.4 mantas/diving) and Isla Socorro (1.2 mantas/diving). In the case of environmental variables, the sst fluctuated between 23.5 and 27.6 °C and the chl-a concentration between 0.078 and 0.28 mg/m^3. Unlike other studies, none of the two variables had a significant effect on the relative abundance of mantas in the park.

The reduced water exchange with the seawater surrounding these aggregations can limit the transfer of metabolic substrates or waste products involved with the dominant biological processes of the habitat.  In autotrophic habitats, photosynthesis may increase both oxygen and pH. In heterotrophic habitats lacking appreciable photosynthesis, however, modifications resulting from respiration and calcification can dominate, which generally lower oxygen and pH, elevating stresses on both the habitat former and its residents. Here, we compare the chemistry modification capability of several ecosystem engineers including the California mussel, Pacific oyster, and the purple sea urchin. In a laboratory flow tunnel, we measured vertical gradients of pH and oxygen above and within aggregations of each of these habitat-formers under a variety of seawater velocities. We observed decreases up to 0.1 pH and 25 µmol kg^-1 oxygen in the mussel bed and 0.04 pH and 10 µmol kg^-1in the oyster reef. Gradients were much less pronounced within urchin aggregations with decreases of only 0.01 pH and 3 µmol kg^-1 oxygen observed. The strength of these gradients strongly depends on biological and physical factors like respiration and calcification rates and seawater velocity.

This species was once abundant in the area, however currently the largest known populations of *P. canaliculus* in the area are in aquaculture operations. There is also  an active restoration effort for this species in the area. A biophysical particle tracking model was used to determine potential larval dispersal pathways from aquaculture sites. Results were then compared to a shell microchemistry study which empirically estimated the natal origin of recent settlers at sites throughout the area. The model showed that larvae can settle throughout the FoT. Larvae originating from only a few sites are likely to dominate settlement in the area due to high larval production at these sites. Shell microchemistry suggested recent settlers originated throughout the study area supporting the results of modelling.

TIB has expanded to consider additional factors, including the influence of marine subsidies, although this has rarely been tested. The input of marine subsidies to nutrient-limited islands could cause shifts in population densities, which may result in altered extinction rates and could lead to changes in species richness. In this study, we integrate TIB with the role of ecosystem subsidies in order to understand how nutrients from the ocean can affect terrestrial species diversity and population density of terrestrial breeding birds.

We studied 91 small islands along the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found that avian species richness was affected by both island area and marine subsidies, which are vectored by wind, water, and animals. Avian species richness increased with island area, as expected, but it decreased with marine subsidy.  Population density decreased with island area but increased with marine subsidy. The effect of marine subsidy on density strengthened disproportionately on smaller islands. These patterns suggest that some terrestrial bird species may benefit from marine subsidies at the expense of others. Our results suggest that nutrients from the sea have the potential to alter population densities of higher trophic level terrestrial species, leading to deviations from classical TIB predictions about species diversity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Obrist, D.S.","Simon Fraser University, Hakai Institute","Simon Fraser University, Hakai Institute","Hanly, P.J.","Simon Fraser University, Hakai Institute","Kennedy, J.C.","University of Victoria, Hakai Institute","Fitzpatrick, O.T.","University of Victoria, Hakai Institute","Wickham, S.B.","University of Victoria, Hakai Institute","Nijland, W.",Hakai Institute,"Reshitnyk, L.Y.","University of Victoria, Hakai Institute","Darimont, C.T.","University of Victoria, Hakai Institute","Starzomski, B.M.",10,"Yes, I would like to give a talk","Simon Fraser University, Hakai Institute","Reynolds, J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),MARINE SUBSIDIES DRIVE PATTERNS IN AVIAN ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

However, the contamination level within the Puget Sound and the Salish Sea are largely unknown. The Seattle Aquarium, centrally located on Elliott Bay, uses incoming saltwater pumped directly from Puget Sound for use in animal exhibits. The Aquarium laboratory began filtering seawater through sieves as small as 63 µm to determine if microplastic pollution was coming into the Aquarium and exposing animals in exhibits. After literature searches on methodology and communication with other pollution laboratories in the region, it was determined that there was high variability in protocols and no standard in which to collect, measure, and analyze these particles. Methodology varies greatly due to geographic location, accessibility and cost of equipment, current equipment technology and ultimately researcher preference. A Microplastics Monitoring Workshop was held at the Seattle Aquarium on October 1-2, 2019 and hosted 12 laboratories from British Columbia to Oregon including universities, federal and non-profit organizations.

Identifying spongivorous predators along with consumption quantification of their prey is fundamental for identifying strategies of survivorship from top-down pressures among sponges. In this study we identify the Hawaiian tiger cowrie *Cypraea tigris schilderiana* as an important sponge predator. We examined the feeding preferences of cowries in flow-through aquaria by quantifying the consumption rate of 18 sponge species along with 3 native coral species in Kāne'ohe Bay. Deterrence of crude extracts from prey species against cowries and the whitespotted toby *Canthigaster jactator* were also tested. Overall, cowries avoided corals and completely consumed sponges *Dysidea cf. arenaria*, *Dysidea* sp. 3, and *Dysidea* sp. 7 within 72 h; *Mycale parishi*, *Haliclona caerulea*, *Halichondria coerulea*, and *Cladocroce burapha* within 96 h;  *Mycale grandis*, and *Gelliodes wilsoni* within 144 h. Consumption by cowries resulted in a removal of 567.96 ± 65.47 g of wet sponge tissue per week. Other prey species were either minimally consumed (<50%) or completely avoided. Among avoided sponges, only *Monanchora clathrata* and *Lissodendoryx schmidti* produced cowrie and toby deterrent extracts.

Universal point contacts and understory height were used to assess community composition and structure, which differed significantly between community types. Differences in DO between communities were strongest at the bottom with temporal variation likely driven by physical processes as offshore water masses changed depending on upwelling strength and the presence of internal bores. Patchy understory showed similar DO across depths but differences in relative water movement between bottom and 1 MAB with bottom having the lowest flow. In the dense understory and urchin barren, water movement was similar across depths and DO was higher 1 MAB compared to bottom.

Despite these management efforts, Pismo clam populations have continued to decline in California. Bivalves exhibit body-size scaling, where larger individuals produce more gametes and therefore contribute disproportionately to future recruitment. Recent surveys indicate few legal sized adults and a shifted size structure to smaller individuals, potentially influencing the slow recovery of this species. Our study investigates the reproductive status and body condition of Pismo clams on Pismo Beach, CA. 70 clams were collected monthly between January 2018 and August 2019 and length and height were measured for each clam. 30 clams were weighed (whole mass and desiccated tissue mass) to determine body condition and the remaining 40 clams were analyzed histologically to determine reproductive stage. Preliminary results show that peak reproductive condition occurs in mid to late summer, indicating preparation for spawning in late summer and early fall.

Ensenada´s kelp forests in Baja California, Mexico, are comprised of a variety of kelp patches with multiple anthropogenic pressures. Therefore, we considered this area as a prime example to study how the historical dynamics of these kelp patches have changed over the years along with their capacity to capture carbon. 
 In this study, we used multispectral satellite imagery to monitor changes in giant kelp biomass in Ensenada, from 1989-2017, centering on 5 areas with different anthropogenic pressures. We found a seasonal trend over the years, but a general reduction in total biomass related to heating events. Moreover, we evaluated the general persistence with a total average of 23.3% and found that highly persistent areas, like Punta Banda Sur and Punta San Miguel, are highly related (correlation coefficient= 0.86) to high carbon capture.
Our data suggest kelp forests in this area are comparable with tropical rainforests in the amount of C they can capture per unit area (annual average 8.54 gr C m^-2). Besides, we found an interesting spatial variability with persistent patches of kelp sequestering as much as 900 gr C m^-2 annually.

Despite their importance, forage fishes are relatively under-represented in marine ecological studies and fisheries management plans, and community-level studies of forage fishes are even more uncommon. The goal of this study was to characterize forage fish communities, analyze patterns of spatiotemporal variations in community composition among four spatially separated (>500km) estuaries in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and identify potential drivers of the patterns. Fifty forage fish taxa were identified from a 20-year fishery-independent dataset collected by Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. The four estuaries separated into two distinct groups by latitude based on forage fish community composition: Apalachicola Bay and Cedar Key in the north, and Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor in the south. Further separation occurred between the two northern estuaries, while community composition was similar between the two southern estuaries. Communities differed by season, and temporal analyses revealed a distinct seasonal cycle in forage fish community composition consistent across all estuaries, related to variation in both biotic and abiotic factors.

Resolving larval transport, however, is challenging, because larval distributions are patchy, abundance vary at multiple scales, larval transport is episodic, and multiple physical processes are involved. We measured barnacle settlement daily in a Southern California rocky shore in spring and fall 2014 and 2015, and in spring 2016. Nearshore water temperature, circulation, and sea level were also measured. Larval settlement, and the potential physical transport processes associated with settlement, varied at multiple temporal scales. For example, settlement increased sharply coinciding with a change in the structure of the water column, and in another event, settlement increased strikingly a few weeks after the end of the 2015-2016  El Niño. The first event may be related to alongshore current reversal, downwelling, and the internal tide, and the second event to the return to El Niño-neutral stratification conditions. Observations in another location ~7 km distant, with different nearshore and coastal physiography, indicate consistent biological and physical patterns at some temporal scales, but not at others. Resolving larval transport in the nearshore requires multiple approaches, including settlement and physical time series, as well as observations of larval distribution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pineda, J.","Biology Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution","Environmental and Ocean Sciences, Shiley Center for Science and Technology, University of San Diego","Reyns, N.","Physical Oceanography Department, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution","Lentz, S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,IDENTIFYING PROCESSES AND SCALES IN NEARSHORE LARVAL TRANSPORT FROM SETTLEMENT AND HIGH RESOLUTION PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS,,Invitee,

These provide reference points, such as how depleted the fishery is compared to its unfished state, to inform catches and prevent over-fishing. However, these stock assessments typically need long time series of historical or catch and abundance data, to accurately assess depletion. These data may be difficult to obtain for smaller, or mainly recreational, fisheries. Populations in no-take marine reserves, that are unfished, may therefore help serve as a reference point to determine depletion. One method developed in the past decade uses the ratio of fish density outside to inside the reserve to serve as a proxy reference point for depletion. From this, we can determine catch based on control rules. The density ratio is especially useful because it does not require a long time series of data, and can be applied at a local spatial scale with observable fluctuations in annual recruitment. Two limitations to the original method include failing to account for both strong, periodic recruitment pulses and short-term population dynamics – separate from the long-term, unfished dynamics. Using age-structured spatial population modeling of Black Rockfish (*Sebastes melanops*) populations, I show how these factors can be accounted for to help determine consistent, sustainable catches.

Coral larvae often settle preferentially on or near crustose coralline algae (CCA), but experimental studies show that certain CCA species actually inhibit coral larval settlement.  To investigate the differences between species of CCA shown to facilitate or inhibit coral larval settlement, we characterized the microbiomes and the fluorescent portion of the dissolved organic matter (fDOM) released by two Pacifc species of CCA, *Hydrolithon reinboldii* (facilitator) and *Porolithon onkodes* (inhibitor). *P. onkodes* exuded significant concentrations of humic-like fDOM that potentially enriched for higher prevalence of two distinct OTUs in the clades  Alteromonadales and Oceanospirillales. To further describe the roles of chemical cues in coral larval settlement, we extracted both exuded and tissue-bound metabolites from two Carrbibean species of CCA, *Hydrolithon boergesenii* (facilitator) and *Paragoniolithon solubile* (inhibitor). Metabolite extracts were used to perform settlement assays with larvae of three coral species (*Acropora palmata*, *Diploria labyrinthiformis*, and *Orbicella faveolata*).

In theory, higher diversity increases the probability of functional compensation by redundancy, which increases the resilience of an ecosystem to disturbances. We aimed to evaluate if fish species diversity, functional redundancy and level of resilience were different between MPAs with distinct levels of enforcement and a fishing zone in the Gulf of California. From 2004 to 2017, we conducted visual censuses to register species richness of fish at four sites: a marine reserve (Cabo Pulmo, 23°N), multi-use MPAs (Espíritu Santo, 24°N; Loreto, 26°N), and a fishing zone (San José, 24°N). With information on six functional traits (size, mobility, activity, gregariousness, position, and diet) we calculated functional redundancy. We compared species richness and functional redundancy considering as factor the site; also we evaluated if temporal tendencies in these indices presented correlation with temperature anomalies and hurricanes. Functional redundancy was low in the region (<2 spp/functional group), which make the idea of functional compensation unlikely. However, the marine reserve presented stability in the indices through time, despite the impact of hurricanes and increase of temperature, while the other sites presented significant declines. These results indicate that in spite of the low redundancy, fish assemblages in the marine reserve could be more resilient compared with those present in multi-use MPAs and the fishing zone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramírez-Ortiz, G.","Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste, S.C.","Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste, S.C.","Balart, E.",Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur,"Reyes-Bonilla, H.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),ARE THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS OF THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA RESILIENT?,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

In the marine environment, political borders are essentially imaginary lines that often divide well-connected populations, communities and habitats. Scientific evidence shows that collaboration among nations can improve the effectiveness of program management, conservation, and cost-efficiency. Despite the evidence that the marine region between California (US) and Baja California (Mexico) constitutes a single ecoregion, our research revealed a lack of binational collaboration and differences in knowledge, conservation, and management of trans-boundary marine species. Kelp forest are the most species-rich and productive communities in this marine ecoregion. We found 40 times more scientific articles regarding kelp-forest ecosystems north of the US-Mexico border than those south of it. The case of the critically endangered Giant Sea Bass shows how asymmetries in species protection and differential fishing pressure across political borders may threaten populations through disruption of connectivity and undervalue conservation efforts.

This report card will establish a critical baseline for many ecosystem indicators that can be utilized to create a regional ecosystem management strategy. The Ecosystem Health Report Card will assist regional managers with policy decisions and resource allocation that aligns with the Sustainable LA Grand Challenge’s goals of 100% renewable energy, 100% local water and enhanced ecosystem health by 2050. Specifically, this report card will help with the implementation of the City of L.A’s Green New Deal and the County’s Sustainability Plan’s Ecosystem Health Targets. This will ensure that effective, data-driven decisions are made at the ecotope scale rather than through individual departments and government entities. Finally, as it will be publicly available, it will also act as an educational resource for local stakeholders and the general public to learn more about the natural resources in our region and what issues are currently threatening them as well as the solutions needed to preserve them.

While parrotfishes are mainly herbivores, some species occasionally feed on live corals. They prey upon multiple coral species, but preferentially target *Orbicella annularis*– a endangered species and major reef-building coral. Researchers are concerned that parrotfish predation may contribute to substantial long-term declines in *O. annularis*, particularly if parrotfishes do not scale back predation as its cover decreases. We compared the intensity of predation on *O. annularis* across a gradient of parrotfish biomass, relative *O. annularis* cover, total coral cover and algae cover between St. Croix (where parrotfish are heavily fished) and Bonaire (where their harvest is banned). We also used photo monitoring and ImageJ analysis to quantify healing of *O. annularis* with fresh parrotfish bite scars for up to three months. Preliminary results show that scar healing rate decreased significantly in response to increased initial scar area, decreased significantly over time and decreased as relative coral tissue loss increased. Initial results support that relative area of bite scars to total *O. annularis* cover increases in response to increased parrotfish biomass. These data allow us to model long-term rates of tissue loss in *O. annularis* in response to scar size and density, as well as determine how community composition influences the intensity of predation on this endangered coral species across areas with drastically different fishing pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rempel, H.S.","Biological Sciences Dept., Cal Poly, SLO","Statistics Dept., Cal Poly, SLO","Bodwin, K.N.","Biological Sciences Dept., Cal Poly, SLO","Vanderbloomer, P.","Biological Sciences Dept., Cal Poly, SLO","Ruttenberg, B.I.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS AND LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF PARROTFISH PREDATION ON ENDANGERED ORBICELLA ANNULARIS CORALS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

We sampled larvae from 2014-2016, using a semi-vortex pump to determine how larval vertical distributions varied spatially and temporally with changing hydrodynamic conditions. Barnacle nauplii and cyphonautes larvae were vertically distributed above the thermocline, while brachyuran zoeae and barnacle cyprids were slightly deeper and more associated with the depth of the thermocline.

Yet few studies have directly measured in the field how these processes vary across spatial and temporal scales. In conjunction with the *Thalassia* Experimental Network, we deployed standardized replicate consumer assays of raw squid, dried squid, and seagrass across seven sites in seagrass beds encompassing 20 degrees of latitude (from Crystal River, Florida, USA to Bocas del Toro, Panama) and across three seasons (summer, winter, and spring). We video-recorded and visually observed assays to quantify relative rates of predation, mesopredation, and herbivory over 24 hours. Assays were primarily consumed by marine fishes, and highlight predictable differences in relative consumption rates across scales – region versus reef, and season versus day/night. Relative consumption rates on all prey types were higher at mid-latitudes, with proximity to reef, and in late summer, and declined sharply in the winter and spring. Within reef, relative predation rates were greater at night relative to day, while relative herbivory rates were greater at crepuscular periods. Our findings build upon recent studies of temperature-driven gradients in predation across latitude, and risk-driven gradients in herbivory within reef, relating relative consumption rates to metabolic theory, biodiversity-function, and optimal foraging theory.

Paine’s (1966) classic keystone predation hypothesis predicts that decimation of *Pisaster ochraceus* should initiate coast-wide changes in community structure in the rocky intertidal low zone, with increases in mussels and reductions in low zone diversity. Five years later, sea star abundance has recovered at some sites along the coast. Has this recovery resulted in a rebound of its function as a keystone predator? In spring 2018, we initiated predator exclusion experiments at thirteen sites from southern California to central Oregon. At the termination of the experiment in fall 2019, results showed that rather than a uniform effect of strong keystone predation on communities along the coast, keystone effects varied among sites. We simultaneously quantified predation rate by *Pisaster* on mussels and found that sea star feeding rate also varied among sites. However, high predation rates did not uniformly correlate with strong keystone effects on communities. This lack of correspondence between the two experiments suggests that other factors such as the supply of mussel and barnacle recruits alters the keystone effects of *Pisaster* on intertidal communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Robinson, J.W.",Oregon State University,Oregon State University,"Gravem, S.A.",University of California Santa Cruz,"Raimondi, P.T.",Oregon State University,"Menge, B.A.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ARE WE THERE YET?

Restoration site selection should be informed by temperature and oxygen data to ensure sites are suitable year- round or periodically have cool water and oxygen rich periods. The establishment of Marine Protected Areas can help to mitigate some stressors but not others. Sea urchin removal and ranching may need to be conducted to aid kelp ecosystem recovery. Starving abalone will need to be supported in captive rearing programs or mariculture to avoid mass mortality.

Water samples were collected at dawn, dusk, and prior to chamber removal the following day for carbon chemistry analysis. Our data indicate that these beds act as carbon sources, with negative NCP and increases in inorganic carbon during all months, though eelgrass beds were less of a carbon source than unvegetated sediments. These habitats were less of a carbon source in early spring than in late summer and winter, likely because of anomalously warm temperatures and bed senescence during the summer.

To assess herbivory, small (<10cm) stages of both species were caged or open to herbivory in the field. While both species were consumed, less of the invasive was eaten. Further, *S. horneri* grew faster than *M. pyrifera* when caged. To evaluate if species interactions enhance invasion success or recolonization by the native, we transplanted 3 sizes of *S. horneri* and 1 size (<10cm) of *M. pyrifera* into 3 sites: 1) *S. horneri* dominated, 2) *M. pyrifera* dominated, and 3) sparse algae. We monitored light and growth. All *S. horneri* sizes grew fastest in the bare site and slower in algal-dominated sites; overall, small *S. horneri* grew slowest. In contrast, all *M. pyrifera* lost biomass, regardless of site. Light levels were low in algal-dominated sites and high in the bare site. Taken together, our results suggest colonization into established beds of *S. horneri* or *M. pyrifera* by the opposite species is unlikely due to competition for light. Further, they imply that declines in *M. pyrifera* can facilitate the spread of *S. horneri* and herbivore preference for the native can further enhance *S. horneri* success.

For the number of factors that affect the development of seagrasses and their development, seagrass meadows are complex systems.
A model that can account for the complexity of seagrass meadow dynamics could be of use in their study and conservation. 
Agent-based models (ABM) are a kind of computational model that has been used to simulate complex systems in ecology.
Agent-Based models represent each component of a system and their actions, in this case, each individual of a population.
The main goal of this study is to build, program and validate an ABM that describes the development of the Eelgrass (""Zostera marina"") meadow in the  Punta Banda Estuary, Baja California.
The propsed model was implemente in the programing language Python.
The individuals simulated in the model as a hierarchical arrange of subunits:  phytomers that form branches, which  form individuals. 
The individuals of the model are programed to simulate horizontal growth, branching, asexual reproducción, ageing, and age-related mortality.
The simulated processes correspond to  a submodel, whose parameters were adjusted using Gibbs sampling.
According to a Bayesian test analogous to ANOVA, there is no difference between simulated and observed terminal branch length.

Threatened species of mammals in particular have benefited enormously from strong legislation mandating their recoveries. While this increase in population size is desirable from a conservation perspective, it can have unintended consequences for human activities such as shipping and fishing that operate in the same ocean waters. This presentation will provide an overview of the dramatic increase in whale entanglements in fishing gear in the California Current ecosystem over the last 5 years, and the unprecedented, ecosystem-based science and management efforts marshalled in response. We explore the potential for stakeholder-generated, spatial management measures to reduce both the ecological vulnerability of whales to entanglement and the social vulnerability of fisheries to forced, coastwide closures.

Nevertheless, the physiological plasticity behind its invasiveness capacity is largely unknown. Kelp monitoring programs in Baja California, Mexico, indicate that light availability within the native iconic Giant Kelp forests (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) determines the presence and growth of *Undaria* in their understory. To test this hypothesis and to obtain critical knowledge about the potential interaction between species, we performed a manipulative  in situ experiment based on the  transplantation of juvenile sporophytes of *Undaria* to the understory of a thriving forest, in order to assess their photo-acclimation capacities. After 7 days growing under very low light conditions (8% of the surface irradiance) we measured a wide range of photobiological descriptors and other biological traits such as nitrate uptake, oxidative stress, and growth. Our results demonstrated that *Undaria* was unable to adjust its photosynthetic efficiency, pigments content or its blade bio-optical properties. This low photoacclimative plasticity lead to severe plant carbon unbalance, a reduction in nitrate uptake capacity, and a general decrease in algae fitness. Our results highlight that the extreme light reduction caused by the canopy structure of dense/healthy Giant Kelp forests can constrain the development of *Undaria* in the understory, and hence its invasiveness capacity over these communities with key ecological and socio-economical values.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sánchez-Barredo, M.",University of Baja California,University of Baja California,"Sandoval-Gil, J.

The original native San Francisco Bay (SF Bay) population became extirpated around 1960. Plant material from Morro Bay was used to propagate and reintroduce *S. californica* to SF Bay in 1999, and roughly 30 total plants have survived until now. As these low numbers hardly represent a restored population of *S. californica*, and the plants have not successfully self-recruited from seed, research is needed to understand the best methods to restore *S. californica* populations. The objectives of this project are to 1) determine the effects of abiotic conditions, including freshwater availability and organic matter, on the germination of *S. californica*; and 2) evaluate the efficacy of “arbors” (various configurations of wooden branches as support) to enhance height growth of *S. californica*, which might enhance high tide refuge for endangered animals such as the Ridgway’s rail and the salt marsh harvest mouse.  Results show that *S. californica* seeds have a higher germination rate when exposed to fresher water conditions and that experimental arbors do increase the height and size of plants in an SF Bay salt marsh.

The effects of this alga’s presence on higher trophic levels, such as fish, is unknown. This study quantified the foraging rates of three common reef fishes (*Halichoeres semicinctus*, *Hypsypops rubicundus*, and *Semicossyphus pulcher*) and the abundance of small invertebrate epifauna the fish prey upon associated with understory algae, including *S. horneri*. Foraging observations were made via SCUBA at six sites along the leeward side of Catalina Island. Three of the most abundant native algae and *S. horneri* were collected at all six sites. Fishes foraged at higher rates among the native *Sargassum palmeri*, than the invasive *S. horneri*, even at sites with low algal diversity, and epifaunal abundance was greater on the native algae. Our results indicate that the invasive *S. horneri* negatively impacts the foraging of fishes, perhaps due to the low abundance of epifauna inhabiting this alga. These results suggest that the increasing prevalence of *S. horneri* on rocky reefs in southern California and Baja California may impact higher trophic levels in invaded ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scafidi, K.S.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge","Steele, M.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,THE EFFECTS OF AN INVASIVE ALGA ON THE TROPHIC DYNAMICS OF TEMPERATE ROCKY REEFS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

It has been proposed that sponge abundance increases with depth through 150 m on reefs throughout the Caribbean (the ‘‘sponge increase hypothesis’’). A recent review concluded that there was not sufficient evidence in the literature to support this hypothesis and that more quantitative studies are needed. In this study, percentage cover of sponges, macroalgae, and hard corals was estimated using images taken by remotely operated vehicles on mesophotic reefs off the coasts of Puerto Rico (to 180 m) and St. Thomas, and on the Flower Garden Banks (both to 100 m). Off Puerto Rico, sponge cover decreased with increasing depth below ~ 100 m, driven primarily by a decline in emergent (non-encrusting) sponge cover. Sponge cover did not change with depth off St. Thomas or on the Flower Garden Banks and was an order of magnitude lower on the Flower Garden Banks. The data from these three locations did not support the sponge increase hypothesis. Off Puerto Rico, cover of macroalgae decreased with depth in a manner similar to sponge cover, which may reflect a positive relationship between sponges and macroalgae in the lower mesophotic zone ( > 100 m). Off St. Thomas and on the Flower Garden Banks, which were both shallower sites with more abundant macroalgae, sponge abundance was likely limited due to competition for space. Generalizations about patterns of sponge abundance across mesophotic depths await further studies, but our data suggest a depth-dependent relationship with macroalgal abundance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scott, A.R.",University of California Davis,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"Battista, T.A.",University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Blum, J.E.",University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Noren, L.N.",University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Pawlik, J.R.",,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DEEP THOUGHTS: DOES SPONGE COVER INCREASE WITH DEPTH ON CARIBBEAN MESOPHOTIC REEFS?,"No, I would not like my work to be judged/am not presenting",Invitee,

As a result, records of basic changes that have occurred to biodiversity and the environment are often missing. When baseline data are absent, the long-term local ecological knowledge of scientists, naturalists, and others can provide a powerful opportunity to understand the past. In an on-going project to reconstruct ecosystem changes in Monterey Bay, CA, we interviewed approximately 50 people who were students or researchers in Monterey Bay from 1938 to 2019.

The scarcity of fleshy algae was attributed to strong top-down control by a diverse suite of consumers. That research, however, did not consider the influence of upwelling events which deliver deep, cold, nutrient-rich water to shallow coastlines, and can alter top-down control by marine grazers. The Pacific coast of Panama is exposed to seasonal upwelling events that generate seasonal and regional contrasts in near-shore hydrologic conditions, making it an ideal location to study the influence of oceanographic processes on tropical coastal ecosystems. We established herbivore exclusion experiments in six rocky intertidal sites nested within three regions exposed to different upwelling regimes. The experiments were repeated during two upwelling and two non-upwelling seasons, allowing us to explore temporal and regional variability in oceanographic conditions and herbivory. Our results indicate that upwelling activity has an important regulatory effect on herbivory and algal abundance on rocky shores along the Pacific coast of Panama. Herbivore effects declined during upwelling season within upwelling regions, while the strength of herbivory remained strong throughout the year in regions without upwelling activity. The temporal and spatial components of our research allowed us to show that temperature and nutrient availability can vary strongly in select tropical sites, leading to seasonality in top-down control by herbivores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sellers, A.J.",Smithsonian Tropical Research Insitute and McGill University,University of Florida,"Altieri, A.H.",McGill University,"Leung, B.",Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute,"Torchin, M.E.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,SEASONAL UPWELLING INCREASES ALGAL COVER AND WEAKENS HERBIVORY ON PANAMANIAN ROCKY SHORES,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Since this time, kelp forest ecosystems have been under increased pressure from a growing number of anthropogenic stressors including climate change. This raises questions as to the long-term value of marine protected areas (MPAs). We present twenty years of monitoring data across three long-established no-take MPAs in northern New Zealand to examine the role MPAs play in protecting kelp forest ecosystems.   Biomass of predatory fish and lobster remain considerably higher in MPAs than in adjacent fished areas despite widespread collapse of adjacent fisheries. Within all three marine reserves kelp forests have now recovered on reefs previously dominated by urchin barrens, whereas on shallow fished reefs in all three locations urchin barrens and turfing algae remain dominant. Following recovery, kelp forests have remained stable in marine reserves, whereas fished reefs exhibited greater variability, fluctuating between urchin barrens, turfing algae and kelp forest at some sites.  These long-term and contrasting patterns between fished and protected reefs unequivocally demonstrate the ecosystem-level consequences of fishing on kelp forests and how marine protection can promote recovery and increased resilience of kelp forests.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shears, N.T.",University of Auckland,University of Auckland,"Peleg, O.",University of Auckland,"Blain, C.O.",University of Auckland,"Allard, H.",University of Auckland,"Hanns, B.",University of Auckland,"Haggitt, T.R.",CSIRO,"Babcock, R.C.",,,,,7,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,LONG-TERM MARINE RESERVE PROTECTION UNEQUIVOCALLY DEMONSTRATES THE ECOSYSTEM-LEVEL CONSEQUENCES OF FISHING ON KELP FORESTS,,Invitee,

RECOVERY OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA KELP FORESTS FOLLOWING DESTRUCTIVE SEA URCHIN GRAZING,"Along California’s Central Coast, active sea urchin grazing recently transformed expansive kelp forests to areas either entirely sea urchin “barrens”, or to patchy mosaics of forest and barrens. In this study, I investigated two fundamental mechanisms for the recovery of kelp forests: (1) functional changes in urchin grazing behavior as a result of a shift in foraging modality (i.e., passive grazing on drift vs active grazing on live kelp) or movement, and (2) direct reduction of sea urchin density in barrens through mortality (as a result of predation, disease, or wave disturbance). Data on sea urchin density, size-frequency, and kelp density were collected through *in situ* field observations paired with 1m^2 photo quadrats. Photo quadrats were analyzed for the presence of exposed sea urchins and a universal-point-contact method was used to estimate cover of foliose algae. Results from three years (2016-2019) of extensive surveys indicate kelp forests recovered in barren patches following sea urchin movement to shallow water. *Nereocystis luetkeana* was the first habitat-forming kelp to colonize the deep water (15-20 meter) reef, followed by an understory stipitate (*Pterygophora californica*) and then *Macrocystis pyrifera*. The reduction of sea urchins in barren patches and the subsequent recovery of kelp forests appeared to be directly related to sea urchin movement and not mortality.

Typically, native species confer resistance by outcompeting or preying on non-native invaders. Here we ask whether fear of native predators can also provide biotic resistance. We use fishery-dependent diet studies and a field experiment on coral reef patches in The Bahamas to examine the consumptive and non-consumptive effects of native grouper predators on invasive, Indo-Pacific lionfish. Stomach content analysis of 200+ groupers revealed that direct predation is rare. We released tagged juvenile lionfish onto 11 reefs that varied naturally in grouper densities, and monitored lionfish behaviour over five weeks. At dawn, during peak grouper hunting times, small lionfish spent more time hiding, and thus less time feeding, on reefs with more groupers. There was no evidence of a trophic cascade: reduced lionfish predation on reefs with more groupers did not result in more lionfish prey. The seasonal peak in prey fish recruitment, which occurred during our study, might have masked the effects of lionfish predation. Fear of native predators by lionfish may reduce invader foraging success, but might not fully mitigate the effects of these invaders on native prey communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith, N.S.",Simon Fraser University,Simon Fraser University,"Côté, I.M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),BIOTIC RESISTANCE THROUGH FEAR OF PREDATORS ON CARIBBEAN CORAL REEFS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

It is also necessary to understand the appropriate spatial and temporal scale to observe these nutrient dynamics, as local circulation processes may play a critical role in nutrient delivery to aquaculture farms. Here, we use a combination of satellite imagery, *in situ* measurements, modeling, and known relationships between nutrient concentrations and kelp growth to estimate nutrient fields across multiple spatial scales (100 m to 25 km) and produce an optimal siting map for large, offshore aquaculture operations that could grow giant kelp for biofuel and other valuable products. Surface nutrient concentrations were modeled using daily sea surface temperature imagery at three spatial resolutions (25 km, 1 km, 100 m) using several satellite sensors including MODIS Aqua/Terra, AVHRR, VIIRS, and Landsat 8, and reveal zones with relatively high nutrient concentrations. Temperature to nutrient relationships were estimated from the empirical relationships between temperature and nitrate/phosphate measurements using generalized additive models, and cross validated with both offshore and nearshore *in situ* nutrient measurements.

We know that corals of different taxa differ in their susceptibility to bleaching, but bleaching may also disproportionately affect different sized corals within a genus or species. We investigated the relationship between colony size and bleaching-induced mortality following a severe, landscape-scale coral bleaching event in Moorea, French Polynesia in 2019. We assessed mortality across all size classes, from single-polyp recruits to the largest adult individuals for corals in the two dominant genera, Acropora and Pocillopora. We found that coral recruit morality was extremely high, with 98% mortality during this bleaching event, as compared to 67% mortality in a previous year. To assess mortality of juveniles (<5cm) and adult corals we quantified colony size, bleaching, and mortality for >2,700 individuals across 10, 15×1m belt transects. We found a strong, positive relationship between colony size and the percent of colonies with significant mortality (>50% colony mortality) for both Acropora and Pocillopora. For Pocillopora, mortality corals <10cm was low, with <2% of individuals with significant mortality. In contrast, >80% of individuals >35cm diameter had significant mortality.

After the 2015-16 Niño event, we monitored abundance, size and physiological performance of three common intertidal kelps (*Saccharina sessilis*, *Egregia menziesii*, *Postelsia palmaeformis*) across 300 km of the Oregon coast for three years. We found coastal upwelling, and by extension nutrient availability, plays a crucial role in modifying the strength of El Niño on the intertidal kelps. In the persistent upwelling region of southern Oregon, *S. sessilis* generally recovered faster with higher abundance, growth and photosynthesis rate than in the intermittent upwelling regions of central and northern Oregon. However, the other intertidal kelps (*E. menziesii* and *P. palmaeformis*) experienced low abundance and high breakage in 2018, possibly from warming of the Oregon coast. Given the greater uncertainty associated with upwelling intensification in the California current and its biological implications, the findings could provide insights into how climate change influences the role of nutrient availability and temperature on the California Current Marine Ecosystem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spiecker, B.J.",Oregon State University,Oregon State University,"Menge, B.A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,EXPLORING SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE STRENGTH OF EL NIÑO ON OREGON INTERTIDAL KELPS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition in sites that are connected through dispersal. We assessed the contributions of metacommunity processes to community structure in an important coastal habitat, seagrass meadows, across approximately 1000 km along the coast of British Columbia. We parametrized a hierarchical joint species distribution model describing the relationship between environmental conditions, spatial distance between sites, and random effects on epifaunal invertebrate species distributions across thirteen eelgrass (*Zostera marina* (L.)) meadows. Compositional similarity did not decrease at large spatial distances suggesting sites are well-connected by dispersal, but observed species distribution patterns suggested dispersal rates are not so high that they homogenize regional diversity. We found evidence of niche filtering in several species along an abiotic gradient; however, environmental conditions only explained a small fraction of the overall variation in species distributions, suggesting variable niche width among species and the contribution of processes other than niche filtering.

Globally, these beds of unattached, branching coralline algal nodules create a fragile ecosystem, often acting as nursery habitat. Santa Catalina Island supports numerous beds, all of which are threatened by intensive boat mooring systems. Despite beds being within marine protected areas, the ecological role of Catalina Island rhodoliths is poorly understood. To characterize this ecosystem we 1) established metrics to describe spatial and temporal patterns of community variability among six Pacific rhodolith habitats at Catalina Island and 2) quantified population characteristics to identify species using beds as nursery habitat, 3) compared data to Méxican and other Pacific beds. Surveys of rhodolith characteristics, macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes were conducted in six rhodolith beds over three sampling periods. Rhodolith cover, heterogeneity and species abundances within beds were positively correlated suggesting that invertebrates and fish may associate with rhodoliths for habitat and food provision. Size frequency data suggests Catalina Island rhodolith bed habitats act as a persistent nursery grounds for the gastropod *Megastrea undosum* and the urchin *Lytechinus pictus*. While high in biodiversity, Catalina Island rhodolith beds are also the most disturbed along the Pacific coast.

By depleting the settlement options for other benthic taxa, PAC accentuates the risks of declining population size for scleractinian corals. Although remaining low in density, current populations of *Diadema antillarum* may adopt important roles in promoting coral recruitment where the cover of PAC is reduced by grazing. On the shallow reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, aggregates of *D. antillarum* create grazing halos of bare space and reduced PAC cover. Adjacent to these halos, PAC-dominated areas are associated with reduced densities of coral recruits. To test the hypothesis that the grazing halos provide ecologically important refuges for coral recruits, this study evaluated the distribution of corals in *D. antillarum* halos and on adjacent substrata as a function of PAC density (high vs low). Quadrats were placed within halos to quantify the density of scleractinians and were repeated on adjacent substrata outside halos; PAC cover was assessed in both locations. Within halos, mean densities of corals ranged from 10 colonies/0.25m^2 in PAC-free areas to 22 colonies/0.25m^2 in PAC-dominated areas. This pattern of distribution was reflected in a significant statistical interaction between *D. antillarum* clusters and PAC abundance for density of corals.

While most reviewers and editors aim to objectively evaluate manuscripts, there are systemic and inherent biases that creep into the peer review process and undermine both the science and the scientists. Many of the inequalities and inequities of peer review outcomes have been well-studied; however, these studies have not specifically assessed the content of the reviews, and the downstream effects that unfair, biased, and *ad hominem* comments may have on authors. In an anonymous survey of 1100 international participants in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, we investigated the pervasiveness and long-term implications of receiving unprofessional comments as an author during peer review. We specifically evaluated impacts on four intersecting categories of gender and race/ethnicity, and found that all scientists, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity receive unprofessional reviews equally. However, traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields are more likely to report direct, negative impacts on their scientific aptitude, productivity, and career advancement after receiving an unprofessional peer review.

Specifically, seawalls, riprap and other hard structures, often referred to as shoreline armoring, decrease biodiversity and abundance along the associated intertidal. In an effort to mitigate negative impacts of shoreline armoring, resources have been increasingly dedicated to restoration projects. While the benefits of restoration have been well documented for beach and intertidal zones, less is known about impacts on subtidal habitat function and use by nearshore species. Our study aims to address these knowledge gaps by evaluating the effectiveness of shoreline restoration projects, specifically in the context of nearshore salmon and forage fish. We conducted nearshore surveys in Puget Sound, WA for two years along restored, armored and natural shorelines to estimate presence of seven forage and salmonid species. We found that forage fish were 5-11 times more likely, and salmon species twice as likely, to be found along natural or restored shorelines than developed shorelines. Spatial patterns in species presence leads us to hypothesize that these patterns may arise from variation in fish life history and the larger landscape context of the study site. We qualitatively evaluate how these mechanisms may drive observed patterns of habitat use. Overall, out study indicates that restored shorelines are preferentially used by forage fish and salmon and may be critical for the continued recovery of these species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sullaway, G.H.",NOAA NWFSC,"University of Washington, Tacoma","Francis, T.B.",NOAA NWFSC,"Samhouri, J.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,LANDSCAPE CONTEXT AND FISH LIFE HISTORY MEDIATE SHORELINE RESTORATION BENEFITS,,Invitee,

For effective management, it is critical to know whether these shifts are smooth, threshold responses or bifurcations indicating alternative stable states (ASS). Herbivorous fishes promote healthy reefs by consuming algae, and empirical evidence demonstrates functionally diverse fish communities are important. However, herbivore functional diversity is often missing in models testing for ASS. We incorporated herbivore functional groups (grazers, browsers, generalists) into a coral reef model to determine how this affects model predictions of the impact of fishing pressure on coral reef health and resilience. Our model predicts that herbivore community composition and fishing pressure interact to determine conditions that support a healthy coral reef state. A healthy reef is promoted by herbivore functional complementarity. However, as fishing pressure increases, functional redundancy becomes important for supporting a healthy reef. Herbivore community composition can interact with types of algal cover to affect conditions supporting healthy reef states. Also, depending on which herbivore group is dominant, reefs will exhibit bistability and hysteresis for varying ranges of fishing pressure. Overall, incorporating functional groups into coral reef resilience models provides novel insights about which functional groups are more important for healthy reefs and what conditions will cause bistability and hysteresis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sura, S.A.",UCLA,UCLA,"Fong, P.",UCLA,"Lloyd-Smith, J.O.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,A FUNCTIONAL GROUP MODEL DEMONSTRATES KEY HERBIVORE GUILDS SHAPE THE RESILIENCE OF CORAL REEF ECOSYSTEMS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

This process is dynamic, with coastal upwelling processes creating a mosaic of pH conditions along the west coast of North America.  In regions of low pH, marine populations may be locally adapted to such conditions and potentially pre-adapted to future OA.  We compared responses to OA among two different populations of the red abalone (*Haliotis rufescens*); one that experiences high levels of upwelling and low associated pH (Mendocino Coast) and one that experiences less intense upwelling and higher pH (Santa Barbara Channel).  Animals were cultured from embryos to post settlement juveniles under both contemporary pH values (8.0 pH, 400 μatm CO~2~) and more acidic conditions (7.6 pH, 1200 μatm CO~2~).  Mendocino abalone exhibited elevated maternally provisioned lipid concentrations during larval and post-settlement phases and grew more slowly than the Santa Barbara (SB) population.  High CO~2~ did not reduce survival in the Mendocino population, whereas the faster growing SB population experienced a 40% reduction in survival.  Experiments on SB F2 generation animals generated similar results.  Notably, a minority of family lineages from SB were resilient to OA, with no significant increase in mortality under low pH exposure.

The Hawksbill sea turtle (*Eretmochelys imbricata*) is a critically endangered species, with the eastern Pacific population as the most threatened one. Although many studies have shown that hawksbills forage on sponges in reef systems, the eastern Pacific population is known to spend extensive periods in mangrove estuaries. Among other potential uses, it is likely that hawksbills use mangrove estuaries as foraging habitat, but globally mangroves are experiencing unprecedented losses. The objective of this study was to use fecal samples to identify the diet of hawksbills utilizing mangrove habitat. Here, we analyze the composition of 13 fecal samples of Hawksbill turtles found fortuitously by divers on the benthos (2-6 m depth) of a mangrove estuary on Isla San Jose, Sea of Cortez, Mexico between 2016 and 2018. The primary components of the fecal samples were sponges (44.2%), followed by colonial tunicates (21.7%), mangrove roots (15.3%), algae (12.0%), sediment (4.2%), and other invertebrates (0.7%). Our data suggest that mangrove estuaries are key foraging areas for Hawksbill turtles in the Sea of Cortez, with species of sponge and tunicate as primary dietary components.

I found that increasing group size was associated with diminishing parasite burden for two trematode taxa and one cestode taxon, but increasing parasite burden for one monogene and one nematode taxon. Two other nematode taxa were not affected by group size. Group size was unrelated to raw parasite taxon richness and the jackknife estimate of parasite taxon richness. The encounter-dilution effect could explain why increasing group size decreases the burden of larval trematodes. Dietary differences between solitary and social fish could explain why the burden of cestodes decreases with increasing group size while the burden of one nematode taxon increases with increasing group size.

Giant kelp may locally increase DO and pH due to their large, productive canopy, which also alters hydrodynamic conditions. Work by our group suggests that biogeochemical differences in the upper water column inside and outside of kelp forests are more pronounced in surface waters. Here, we investigated the contributions of the kelp canopy and phytoplankton to biogeochemical variability in surface waters. We deployed pH, DO, and temperature sensors inside and outside of two kelp forest sites during the summers of 2018 and 2019. We also collected twice-weekly discrete samples of dissolved inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon (POC), and chlorophyll. Inside the kelp forest surface DO rose above subsurface levels from mid-day to early evening. Outside, DO rose above subsurface levels on an event-scale, corresponding with phytoplankton blooms. POC was generally lower inside the kelp forest, indicating that kelp rather than phytoplankton drives diel patterns in surface DO in the kelp forest. The upper few meters of the water column were usually more thermally stratified within the kelp forest than outside. This is likely due to the presence of the canopy increasing water residence time and reducing turbulent mixing, allowing more time for warming as well as for kelp to modify surface biogeochemistry.

Specifically, we found evidence of narrowing of channels, replacement of *S. foliosa* with species typically found higher in the salt marsh (e.g., *Salicornia pacifica*), and steady continuation of accretion rates. While sea level rise associated with global climate change is expected to shift distributions of salt marsh plants upwards, at the Tijuana Estuary the effects of sea level rise are being counteracted by sedimentation.

We used western blots to determine the relative abundance of two proteins that play important roles in regulating the oxidative stress response, the mitochondrial sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) at 6 h and 30 h into stress. In cold stressed mussels, SIRT5 abundance decreased when compared to the controls. However, the opposite was the case for SOD1 abundance, which was higher in control mussels.

Hence, our study aims to describe and compare the community structure and functional diversity of fishes at depths ranging from 12 to 94 m in continental islands (Espíritu Santo and Cerralvo) and oceanic islands (San Benedicto, Socorro, and Clarión) in the Mexican Pacific during Fall 2018. We used a ROV to record 81 video-transects of five minutes each. In each of them, we determined the fish species, species richness, taxonomic diversity, trophic level, and functional richness using presence data. We found that continental islands have higher species richness and a more uneven taxonomic tree, although oceanic islands are more taxonomically diverse, with a higher trophic level and functional richness. San Benedicto and Socorro showed a higher number of species, greater functional richness, and greater taxonomic diversity, in contrast to Clarión, Espíritu Santo, and Cerralvo. Nonetheless, we observed more functional entities on Espíritu Santo, which allowed a greater volume, meaning that less niches are unused. Although trophic level didn’t vary statistically, oceanic islands showed higher values, which implies less fishing pressure on high trophic levels. We conclude that, based on taxonomic diversity and trophic level, oceanic islands are healthier and more pristine than their counterpart.

For example, temporarily exposing adult Pacific oysters (*Crassostrea gigas*) to low pH prior to gametogenesis affects larval abundance. The documented effect on Pacific oyster larval abundance indicates a potential role for epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation, in response to ocean acidification. To assess how ocean acidification affects the oyster epigenome, DNA was extracted from adult oysters exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for seven weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions.

Kelp forest ecosystems of the California Current region are subject to extreme environmental variability as well as a suite of fishing pressures, which remove organisms throughout the food web. We built a mass-balanced model of a kelp forest ecosystem near the southern limit of distribution in the northern hemisphere (Isla Natividad, Mexico). The model is informed by extensive ecological monitoring of fish, benthic invertebrates, and macroalgae obtained through 10-year, allowing the results of the model to be more precise and realistic. We unified two different techniques of ecological monitoring and models that are often used to improve the knowledge of the structure of ecosystems. In this study we estimated energy flow within functional groups, as well as the direct and indirect interactions between them and between the fishing fleets. This has led to a greater understanding of a complex coastal ecosystem with great potential to inform conservation measurements and better management practices. Based on this model, a dynamic phase is being generated that allows seeing space-time changes of the species.

It shows high biodiversity (>350 species) and productivity, where mysids are key species in the estuarine food web as main prey for early life stages of marine crustaceans and fishes, especially for European anchovy *Engraulis encrasicolus* and Iberian sardine *Sardina pilchardus*. Both are abundant forage fishes of great ecological and economic importance for the Gulf of Cadiz marine ecosystem. Long time series analysis and GAM modelling of both estuary and fisheries datasets show how damming of the Guadalquivir river (since 1930) results in reductions in freshwater discharge and changes from the historical seasonality, which have led to decreases in anchovy and sardine juveniles in the estuary through cascading up by reduction of mysids, hence influencing recruitment and evolution of fisheries biomass stocks in the Gulf of Cádiz.

Quantifying diets of planktivorous animals can be difficult as plankton can lack diagnostic characters as larvae and are digested at variable rates. With the use of DNA metabarcoding, the identification of taxa within gut contents has become faster and more accurate, and allows for higher taxonomic resolution while also identifying rare and highly degraded items. We used DNA metabarcoding to examine the diet of the giant plumose anemone *Metridium farcimen*, a large, abundant, competitively-dominant anemone in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Gut contents were compared to concurrent, nearby plankton samples. The objectives of this study were both to determine if *M. farcimen* has a selective diet and to compare our findings with published, traditional gut content analyses. *M. farcimen* captures a wider range of prey than previously suspected and metabarcoding can find many more taxa than traditional sampling techniques. There were no overrepresented taxa in the gut contents compared to the plankton but there were many underrepresented taxa indicating that many species can escape predation or are too small to be detected.

However, ecosystem-level impacts of prey behavior in subtidal systems have proved difficult to quantify at large spatiotemporal scales. In 2015, the widespread outbreak of sea star wasting disease along the California coast presented a unique model system to evaluate the impacts of reef-scale predatory *Pisaster* removal on the grazing behavior and life history characteristics of resident subtidal turban snail populations (*Tegula spp.*) in the field. Based on the behavioral and physiological responses of *Tegula* to localized sea star extinctions observed during our empirical study, we developed a set of novel dynamic population models assessing the potential for predator removal events in this system to drive cascading grazing impacts on lower trophic levels. In all models, snail mortality rates were held constant so that only non-consumptive predator effects were considered. Results indicate that even historically low densities of sea stars can potentially maintain strong behaviorally mediated regulation of snail grazing activity, resulting in local stabilization of primary producers (i.e. giant kelp, benthic understory algae). However, when resident sea star populations were entirely extirpated, food web dynamics became unstable, and overutilization of slow-growing benthic algae resulted in population crashes and kelp forest loss in nearly all model scenarios, particularly under suboptimal environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wetmore, L.S.","Department of Biology and Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Department of Biology and Coastal and Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Anderson, T.W.","Department of Environmental Science and Policy, University of California, Davis","Hastings, A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,A BEHAVIORALLY MEDIATED TROPHIC CASCADE PREDICTED BY SEA STAR WASTING DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA KELP FORESTS,"Yes, I would like to be judged in the GRADUATE STUDENT category",Invitee,

Known impacts of marine heatwaves include changes in population size and structure, range shifts, and species replacements for one or a few species within an ecosystem, but we have yet to adequately explore how marine heatwaves affect entire assemblages. We utilize a nine-year time series of intertidal seaweed cover across three sites at high taxonomic resolution from Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada, to explore the impacts of a recent wide-ranging heatwave – the ‘blob’ of 2014-2016. We find that while local species richness remained relatively stable throughout the time series, total algal cover fluctuated greatly, decreasing during the heatwave at all sites and rebounding afterwards at most. Assemblages changed in a variety of ways, from largely oscillatory dynamics in low intertidal and wave-exposed areas to more directional trajectories in high intertidal wave-protected areas. Across >100 species of seaweed and invertebrates, we found several taxon-specific responses during the heatwave, with sessile invertebrates being more sensitive to winter temperature anomalies and seaweeds to summer anomalies. Our results support growing evidence that ecological impacts of climate disruptions are dependent on existing spatial heterogeneity in the environment, and the varied responses we document across species suggest that predictions around ecological responses to abiotic stress may require updating.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Whalen, M.A.",Hakai Institute,University of Victoria,"Starko, S.",University of British Columbia,"Lindstrom, S.C.",University of British Columbia,"Martone, P.T.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to give a talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,COMMUNITY-LEVEL RESPONSES OF INTERTIDAL SEAWEEDS TO A MARINE HEATWAVE IN CENTRAL BRITISH COLUMBIA,,Invitee,

We analyzed spatially-explicit empirical atmospheric, economic, and biological data to estimate tradeoffs between electrical power gains possible from developing wind farms along the Central Coast and impacts the farms could have on fisheries revenue and seabird populations. We compared potential development locations, including the Morro Bay and Diablo Canyon Call Areas designed by BOEM, and identified those that best mediate tradeoffs among energy, fisheries, and seabird conservation objectives. We found large variation in potential gains and impacts across the domain, indicating ample opportunity to mediate tradeoffs with strategic spatial planning. Locations farther from shore mediate the tradeoffs best by allowing for both higher power production and lower fisheries and seabird impacts. Compared with areas we identify, neither Call Area is optimally located or configured for mediating the tradeoffs; however, both are better than more nearshore areas. Morro Bay mediates the power-fisheries tradeoff better than Diablo Canyon; it remains uncertain if one better mediates the power-bird tradeoff.

These range shifts could create opportunities for new interactions between species. Although important ecological theories (e.g. Enemy Release Hypothesis, Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability) benefited by studying such novel interactions in a pairwise fashion, less is known about how range shifts could impact the broader native plant community. For example, invasions may replace high preference natives with low preference invasives, thereby shifting herbivory onto other intermediate-to-high preference natives. We tested this hypothesis by asking how the current invasion of *Sargassum horneri* in Southern California could impact grazing on three other intertidal seaweeds via replacing kelp wrack– a high preference food source. Recent reports suggest that such impacts are possible given the negative impacts of *Sargassum* on kelp. We compared grazing by a realistic herbivore assemblage on agar-based foods made from two seaweed assemblages – one containing palatable native kelp and one replacing kelp with unpalatable invasive *Sargassum*. As predicted, this replacement shifted consumption onto the other natives, particularly the high preference seaweed, *Silvetia compressa*.

Whether an MPA achieves this expectation is typically evaluated by assessing trends in abundance after implementation. However, the underlying assumption that harvest has actually ceased is rarely tested directly. Determining whether harvest has continued in an MPA is important to planning enforcement actions and to interpreting trends in abundance and biomass in an adaptive management context.  Here, we estimated harvest rate for four kelp forest fish species inside MPAs and at non-MPA reference sites in the California Channel Islands. We were able to estimate harvest rates by fitting a size-structured population model to time series of subtidal diver surveys of fish size and abundance collected by the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) at each site. Data spanned 2003 (when MPAs began) to 2017. Overall, we found that harvest rate (measured as the instantaneous rate *F*) was effectively zero in reserves and varied from near zero to greater than one (in units of year^-^1) in reference sites. This indicates successful adherence to MPA regulations, and possible displacement of fishing effort to reference sites. However, a greater-than-zero harvest rate was found in one MPA site, highlighting the importance of assessing this quantity in an adaptive management context.

Recently, encrusting macroalgae described as “peyssonnelid algal crust” (PAC) have increased in abundance on shallow reefs throughout the Caribbean, due in part to their strong capacity for rapid growth and spatial competition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of PAC in driving changes in coral community structure on Caribbean reefs. On the shallow reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, the cover of PAC was affected by wave exposure and depth, with PAC covering 64% of reef surfaces at 3 m depth in exposed sites, but 48% at 3 m depth in sheltered sites, and within the exposed site, 64% at 3 m depth and 35% at 9 m depth. Independent of depth or wave exposure, PAC was growing on top of coral in 78% of PAC-coral interactions. To investigate the consequences of these interactions, we tested the effects of PAC on the growth of juvenile massive *Porites* spp. placed in contact with PAC. The experiment was conducted in the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, using PAC-coral interactions staged on tiles grown on a common garden. The growth of massive *Porites* was unaffected by contact with PAC over 3 weeks.

However, when examining functional roles, species may overlap in their functional traits (FTs), resulting in more functionally redundant communities. This may dictate the relationship between ecosystem functioning and stability, as more redundant communities may provide lower ecosystem functioning but be more stable to disturbances. Here we examined 13 FTs of fish consumer communities in Rhode Island coastal ponds, based on three functional roles: energy acquisition, locomotion, and nutrient recycling, to test the effects of functional diversity and redundancy on ecosystem functioning and stability. We fit GAMs to our 13 FTs and used these models to predict FTs based on species identity and length in a six-year fish survey. We calculated two multivariate functional diversity metrics: richness and redundancy, as well as ecosystem functioning and temporal stability of fish biomass to examine spatiotemporal changes in functional diversity and whether a stability-functioning tradeoff exists due to functional redundancy. Functional richness differed across time and space while redundancy was high for all communities. Both functional richness and redundancy were positively correlated with ecosystem function and stability resulting in no trade-off.

Through the University of Hawaiʻi, certain classes have also been tailored to the introduction and implication of these said indigenous methods.

In tropical reefs echinoids feeding on macroalgae is avoid the phase shift phenomenon and favor to bioerosion high rates. The objective of this study was to observe changes of functional diversity of Echinoidea at Espiritu Santo Archipelago National Park from 2005 to 2017, using data from the official monitoring program of the marine protected area. To determine species richness and abundance, census of sea urchins were conducted in belt transects 30 x 2 m, and these data were combined with a series of 13 not correlated morphological traits of the 6 observed species, to define morphofunctional diversity at each transect. The results showed statistically significant differences for abundance, and functional richness, evenness and diversity in the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 in relation to 2006 and 2007, being lower in recent years. Although urchin abundance was higher in 2007. Also, the temporal trend obtained by a linear regression showed a decrease in the index. The pattern of sea urchin decrease has previously been detected in marine protected areas, and results from an increase in the biomass of predatory fish when regulation of fishing activities is implemented, and due to trophic cascade effects they regulate and decrease the echinoids community. Under this view, the protection of species of carnivorous fish has negatively affected the invertebrate fauna",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amador, D.",Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur,Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur,"Reyes-Bonilla, H.",Sociedad de Historia Natural Niparajá,"Jaume-Schinkel, S",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although predators do not always consume prey, they can elicit non-consumptive effects (NCEs), as prey change behaviors to avoid predators, and allocate resources to defend against predation. By spending more time avoiding predators, prey spend less time foraging, which impacts basal resources, known as trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs). Prey populations that experience greater predation pressure should have stronger NCEs and TMIIs, a hypothesis I tested with *Tegula funebralis*, which are known to respond behaviorally to their primary predators, including *Pisaster ochraceus*, *Romaleon antennarium*, and *Octopus rubescens*. I collected snails from four different populations (Belinda Point, Fort Bragg; Devil’s Gate, Cape Mendocino; Baker Beach, Trinidad; and Pt. St. George, Crescent City) which all vary in abundances of *Tegula’s* main predators. Over a 28-day experiment, I measured avoidance behavior, shell growth, and total growth to measure NCEs, and kelp consumption to measure TMIIs. I observed significant behavioral differences between treatments, however, I did not observe any significant growth differences between treatments. Finally, I observed a significant difference in kelp consumption among sites, with *Pisaster* cue treatment being the only treatment eliciting significantly lower feeding rates at all sites. Overall, I found that *Pisaster*, regardless of *Tegula* source population, are the only predator that induces NCEs and TMIIs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, K.A.",Humboldt State University and California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

The San Francisco Estuary (SFE) experienced a historically wet winter in 2017 when heavy rainfall reduced surface salinities drastically for several months, but the impact of this extended period of low salinity on organisms in the shallow subtidal region of the central bay is unknown. Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) is an important habitat-forming species worldwide, hosting a diverse community of epifaunal invertebrates. I conducted quarterly surveys in six SFE eelgrass beds beginning in July 2017 to quantify shoot density, epiphyte biomass, invertebrate community composition, sediment characteristics, and other factors. Following the low-salinity period, I observed large changes in the invertebrate community compared to pre-2017 data, including the disappearance of two key native species, Taylor’s sea hare (*Phylapllysia taylori*) and the isopod *Pentidotea resecata*. These ecologically important species feed on eelgrass epiphytes, increasing light availability to eelgrass and linking primary production to higher trophic levels. At the same time multiple invasive invertebrates became abundant. These findings reinforce a need to understand weather-related shifts in epifaunal community composition and distribution, as these may critically affect the conservation of critical foundational habitats, especially as climate changes intensify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ayala, G.S.",San Francisco State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

The ecological drivers of parrotfish corallivory and the degree to which parrotfish scale back the predation intensity on corals in response to changes in reef community composition remain poorly understood. The objective of this study is to compare the intensity of parrotfish predation on reef-building corals across a gradient of parrotfish biomass, algae cover and coral cover on reefs in St. Croix and Bonaire. At each site, we surveyed: (1) parrotfish biomass and species composition, (2) the abundance and size distribution of bite scars on coral colonies in relation to coral species and size, and (3) percent cover of coral, algae and other food items targeted by parrotfish. We used a linear mixed effects model to compare the intensity of parrotfish predation on corals in response to differences in parrotfish biomass, algae cover and coral cover. Additionally, we compared patterns of predation at the coral-species level. We found that the intensity of parrotfish corallivory varied regionally and with a number of local factors.

In the Gulf of Alaska, Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasii*) deposit adhesive eggs on a variety of marine vegetation during their spring spawn, where the fertilized roe develops until hatching. Many photosynthesizing species used as spawn substrates can modify the pH of their boundary layer environments during local drawdown of inorganic carbon. The goal of this experiment was to investigate whether a photosynthesizing spawn substrate can mitigate the effects of elevated pCO~2~ and temperature on embryonic development and condition of newly hatched Pacific herring. We raised roe on either *Macrocystis pyrifera* blades or silicone strips under a factorial cross of current spring temperature and pH (pH 7.8, 7℃) and projected end-of-century (pH 7.5, 11℃) conditions in Sitka Sound, AK. Preliminary results indicate that effects of temperature are more pronounced than pH, with warmer temperatures increasing egg respiration and negatively affecting the nutritional status of larvae at hatch. Eggs fertilized on giant kelp blades experienced significantly lower fertilization success than eggs on non-photosynthesizing silicone; however, further assessment of substrate effects were complicated by poor retention of eggs on the blades.

The vocal signals are produced as a static display in which the male does not move with respect to the female, whereas the dive display signals are produced when the male's dive velocity causes a Doppler shift in frequency by up to 8%. Since the male does not hear the effect of the Doppler shift, the sound that they produce is perceived differently by the recipients than by the male transmitters. I compare temporal and frequency characteristics between recorded dives, and songs characterizing the degree of temporal and frequency correspondence between these sounds to determine whether or not the male vocalizations suggest or mimic the Doppler shifted version of his dive sound.

These changes may have profound effects on seagrasses due their narrow thermal tolerances and carbon limitation. We tested how elevated temperature and carbon dioxide affect (1) the growth of eelgrass (*Zostera marina*), (2) the growth of epiphytic algae that competes with eelgrass, and (3) the ability a crustacean herbivore (the grass shrimp *Hippolyte californiensis*) to graze on epiphytic algae. We factorially varied temperature (ambient vs. elevated), CO2 (ambient vs. elevated, based on IPCC predictions), and the presence of grass shrimp in laboratory mesocosms. Trends across all of the trials show that elevated CO2 increased epiphyte growth, while elevated temperature decreased eelgrass growth. We did not find a negative correlation between epiphyte growth and eelgrass growth. Grazing impact by *H. californiensis* was driven by the combination of increased temperature and elevated CO2 levels. Increased temperature appears to lower grazing rates compared to ambient temperature conditions, but the negative effect of elevated temperature on grazing impact was lessened by elevated CO2 levels, suggesting that elevated CO2 may mitigate detrimental effects of warming water on herbivory. However, this effect was reduced under high ambient seawater temperatures, suggesting a temperature threshold for the system.

This increase in population resulted in the urbanization of watersheds. As the landscape of these watersheds changed, so too did the coastal ecosystems they fed. Analyses in one-sub watershed of Los Peñasquitos Lagoon through 1999 revealed that this anthropogenic input resulted in marine-associated habitats being replaced by those associated with freshwater. Our current work extends the spatial and temporal coverage of freshwater input and habitat change in the lagoon. Vegetation within the other two sub-watersheds was mapped from 1986-2018 using aerial images and historical data. This was then analyzed for change in relation to urbanization as determined from San Diego Association of Government Land Use mapping. A shift from saltwater-associated vegetation to freshwater-associated vegetation continues to suggest decreasing salinity in the upper lagoon, and this increased freshwater correlates with increasing urbanization within the watersheds.

Developmental plasticity in thermal tolerance among populations of *T. californicus* is negatively correlated with latitude across North America’s Pacific coast, increasing in southern populations that are adapted to warmer temperatures. By tracking thermal tolerance in different populations over time and rearing multiple generations under a common garden, we found evidence of *in situ* variation in the plasticity of thermal tolerance between northern and southern populations of *T. californicus* experiencing similar rates of seasonal warming. We measured additional traits associated with thermal physiology and found that sex-specific differences in mature body size and respiratory rate under temperature stress increased at higher latitudes.

In addition, we found that, on average, starved urchins interact with the C. californica significantly less frequently, (P < 0.001) and are deterred from foraging significantly more (P < 0.01) than their fed counterparts.

An initial visual analysis used light microscopy to identify plastics and suggested their presence in sediment and surface water. An improved plastic extraction method and chemical analysis procedure was developed.  Samples were filtered through a series of sieves and vacuum filters followed by an adapted enzymatic digestion by proteinase-K in SDS, and density separated using zinc chloride prior to ATR FT-IR analysis. Spectra from these various locations were then analyzed to determine microplastic type. This filtration method paired with ATR FT-IR analysis is an efficient method that avoids plastic degradation and bias of manual sorting, and aids in the identification of microplastic polymers.

The experiment also addresses whether the density of plantings affects success of eelgrass establishment. Oyster reefs were installed in April 2019, and eelgrass was planted in two periods in May and June 2019. A heat wave that occurred right after the second period led to high mortality of transplants from that period. Thus, early monitoring results show the importance of planting date over our other experimental manipulations on initial eelgrass establishment. Supplemental planting early in spring 2020 will re-create our planned treatments and permit evaluation of their effects over time, including on related functions and services such as fish and invertebrate habitat, ocean acidification, and carbon storage.

In this study, we investigated if kelp has a lower photochemical efficiency when directly interacting with Sargassum. We measured the maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) on dark-acclimated tissue of both species via pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometry. Along benthic transect surveys, blades were collected from both species. We collected our samples from two sites that exhibited species interaction, and one site exhibiting complete cover by Sargassum. Our results indicated that Sargassum was significantly more abundant at the Intake Pipes site (ANOVA; p<0.01), and that kelp was significantly more abundant at the Chalk Cove site (ANOVA; p<0.02). At the Cherry Cove site, benthic cover was exclusively Sargassum. Photochemical efficiency remained high in both species (Fv/Fm: 0.767 +/- 0.008) when interacting but was significantly lower at the Sargassum exclusive site Cherry Cove (ANOVA; p<0.01) and associated with algal senescence. Therefore, Sargassum is not negatively affecting the photochemical efficiency of kelp at sites of interaction, and the longevity of Sargassum may be increased in the presence of kelp.

Crabs are highly vulnerable to sea otter predation, and Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) is an essential resource to fisheries and communities in Southeast Alaska. To date trophic linkages among sea otters, eelgrass communities and intermediate predators like crabs result in indirect positive effects on eelgrass mediated through sea otter predation on crabs. Through investigation of crab abundance along a sea otter gradient from 2017-2019, we find that crab abundance and size distribution decreases with increasing sea otter occupation. Larger crabs are completely absent in the presence of sea otters, but interestingly the diversity of crab species increases in the presence of sea otters. Our future studies will examine variation in recruitment as well as explore species interactions among crab species along this sea otter gradient.

We analyzed whether densities, mean and maximum sizes, size distributions, and vertical distributions varied by site and latitude in 2018. The densities of all four species were higher in Oregon than in California, which was driven by a high abundance of juveniles in three out of four of our species. This suggests that Oregon populations have higher rates of reproduction, may have higher survival rates, and thus may be more resilient to rapid changes than California populations. However, toward southern latitudes, the maximum size of both *Nucella* species increase, which may be due to decreased direct and indirect competition at southern sites. We also compared vertical distributions and within-species size distributions in the zone they inhabit.

Encrusting bryozoans of the genus *Membranipora* are a common epiphyte throughout *M. pyrifera’s* range and form a crustose, opaque layer on kelp blades. Reduction of incident light by this layer may  negatively affect photosynthesis thus reducing primary production. This could have implications for kelp growth and surface water chemistry within kelp forests. Effects of bryozoan encrustation on primary production were measured using *in situ* growth surveys and photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) trials from June–August, 2019 in Monterey, CA. Tagged surface blades were measured weekly using a hole-punch method. P/R trials were conducted during the day and night with blades of varying levels of bryozoans inside sealed plastic bags with an oxygen probe. Growth surveys revealed that most blades were no longer growing by the time they were colonized by bryozoans, but encrusted blades showed a slightly higher decline in blade length. Unencrusted blades showed marginally significant higher rates of daytime O~2~ production (F~1,14~ = 4.78, p = 0.046). Recent studies have shown a positive correlation between warming ocean temperatures, recruitment of *Membranipora*, and deforestation of kelp beds. As the oceans continue to warm, outbreaks of this bryozoan could be detrimental to kelp forests and the ecosystem services they provide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cohn, B.C.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Northridge","Nickols, K.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Observational Ecology (Rafe Sagarin Award),,,,

Over the last 50 years, this distinct population has collapsed to less than 1% of its historic abundance, and a gap in our understanding of their population biology is likely limiting our ability to identify causes of decline. Longfin Smelt are believed to have a 2-year semelparous (single spawning) life history strategy; however, detailed studies of Longfin reproductive biology are limited. Determining maturation, batch fecundity, and lifetime fecundity is likely critical to understanding population dynamics and informing conservation. Here, we collected adult Longfin Smelt from South San Francisco Bay during the 2018-2019 winter spawning season and assessed gonad development (gonadosomatic index, GSI) and egg development (stage) as functions of length. Observations of GSI indicated that gonad development may occur in individuals at younger ages or smaller sizes than previously thought, and microscopy of eggs revealed instances of two distinct developmental stages of eggs within individual gonads. Earlier reproductive maturity and greater lifetime fecundity have implications for the population’s ability to rebound and thus remain important considerations for further studies to inform and enhance conservation efforts for this threatened species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooper, A.

Dispersal of larvae is influenced by environmental factors (e.g., climate oscillations, temperature, and currents) as well as biotic factors (e.g., pelagic larval duration time, feeding behavior, and swimming ability). Few studies have utilized long-term, spatially-explicit models to examine factors driving larval distributions across years. Yet developing predictive frameworks and integrating multiple stressors in a spatial context has been cited as an important area for future research. Spatial data in the form of larval fish catch data presents additional sources of sampling error, observation error, and spatial autocorrelation that can be difficult to account for in traditional analytical approaches. However, Bayesian methods can easily incorporate error and correct for autocorrelation while still providing estimates on actual parameter values that can be used for predicting larval abundances at a specific point in space and time. Here, we present preliminary results from a hierarchical, Eulerian-framed Bayesian model that combines long-term empirical CalCOFI catch data with environmental and biotic data to identify how larval distributions vary in space and time from southern Baja to southern California from 1951-2019.

This disease can cause atrophy of the foot muscle and digestive gland degeneration, which prevents nutrient absorption during feeding, causing the death of its host. The WS was first detected in black abalone, *Haliotis cracherodii*, populations in the Channel Islands, California, USA in the mid 80’s, and since has extended progressively to other populations along the coast of United States and Mexico. Withering Syndrome has caused mass mortalities of abalone, resulting in the collapse of the fisheries. In 1993, commercial and recreational black abalone fisheries were closed in California and, in 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service enlisted it in the Endangered Species Act. In recent years, a slow recovery of black abalone populations has been detected in both California and Baja California, however, these populations are still at risk of being affected by the WS, especially due to the stress caused by recent drastic environmental changes. For that reason, it is crucial to evaluate the occurrence of *C*Xc in some of the remaining populations in Baja California. On the other hand, the presence of a phage hyper parasite associated to the *C*Xc called Xenohaliotis phage (p*C*Xc) has been detected in recent years. This phage attacks the bacteria and reduces its pathogenicity. Therefore, we will use a non-lethal sampling and qPCR amplification method to determine the presence of both the bacteria and phague.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Delgadillo-Anguiano, C.",Universidad Autónoma de Baja California,Centro de Investigación Científica y Educación Superior de Ensenada,"Lafarga-De la Cruz, F.",Universidad Autónoma de Baja California,"Lorda, J.",Universidad Autónoma de Baja California,"Abadía-Cardoso, A.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concerns about the potential impacts of microplastics, through chemical pollutant absorption, marine organism ingestion, and biomagnification indicate the importance of further investigation into the presence and types of microplastics in the Puget Sound.  An initial visual analysis used light microscopy to identify plastics and suggested their presence in sediment and surface water. An improved plastic extraction method and chemical analysis procedure was developed.  Samples were filtered through a series of sieves and vacuum filters followed by an adapted enzymatic digestion by proteinase-K in SDS, and density separated using zinc chloride prior to ATR FT-IR analysis. Spectra from these various locations were then analyzed to determine microplastic type. This filtration method paired with ATR FT-IR analysis is an efficient method that avoids plastic degradation and bias of manual sorting, and aids in the identification of microplastic polymers.

How salt marshes will respond depends on their ability to actively build elevation, which is determined by plant productivity and biomass. Yet, salt marsh productivity and biomass are not well-characterized across broad spatial scales or continuously in time. We combined seasonal field surveys and high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery from the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Reserve to investigate the patterns and drivers of salt marsh biomass in the southern California region. We validated the UAV imagery using canopy reflectance captured in situ and found that UAV reflectance correlated highly (r2>0.86) to field measurements. UAV imagery was then used to test a suite of vegetation indices in their ability to predict aboveground biomass. NDVI provided the strongest correlation to aboveground biomass for each season, and when seasonal data were pooled (r2=0.44; rmse=451 g/m2). The NDVI aboveground biomass estimation model (AGB=2657.3*NDVI–59.1) was then used to create maps of biomass for each season. We found that spring exhibited higher average aboveground biomass (1150 g/m2) and total site-wide aboveground biomass in spring was estimated to be 192 Mg, approximately 50 Mg higher than all other seasons. Aboveground biomass peaks highest in spring at elevations ranging from 1.6 – 2.0 m NAVD88, and exhibits sharp declines at higher elevations, especially during summer.

Factors effecting diet composition include environmental conditions as well as habitat qualities such as substrate type and reef structure. An analysis of diet composition comparing multiple types of reefs with differing environmental conditions may inform or be indicative of habitat value for a fish species. In the Southern California Bight (SCB), habitat provided by manmade (harbor breakwaters) and natural reefs exist in close proximity to one another and over a range of varying oceanographic conditions. One fish commonly found on both breakwaters and natural reefs in the SCB are Garibaldi (Hypsypops rubicundus), a fish protected from fishing since 1971. Garibaldi are a territorial damselfish with high sight fidelity. To compare the habitat value of manmade and natural structures for Garibaldi the diet composition of 835 fish collected by divers from 2013-2019 are being analyzed from paired breakwater and natural reefs along a range of environmental conditions within its southern California range.

Members of Acteonoidea have been traditionally classified based on morphological features, resulting in their original placement in Cephalaspidea because of the presence of a headshield. However, recent molecular studies have indicated that their morphology may be homoplastic and have reclassified Acteonoidea into a more basal group sister to Nudibranchia. Few detailed taxonomic studies have addressed the relationships between families and genera in this group. This study will build a molecular phylogeny based on a number of specimens from localities around the globe using two mitochondrial genes (16S and CO1) and one nuclear gene (H3). The goal of this analysis is to attempt to reconcile molecular and morphological data and determine the relationships among members of Acteonoidea. Specifically, it will examine whether Bullinidae is a valid family or is a member of Aplustridae. Preliminary data shows *Bullina* to be nested within Aplustridae and as a sister group to *Micromelo*. A second goal of this study is to determine whether *Micromelo undatus* is truly a circumtropical species or if there is undescribed cryptic diversity.

To examine this relationship, I grew five common species of red and brown intertidal macroalgae under elevated CO~2~ in laboratory mesocosms and observed them in feeding preference trials with two common intertidal grazers, the Northern kelp crab *Pugettia producta* and the black turban snail *Tegula funebralis*. Both grazers demonstrated a strong preference for brown algae, particularly *Egregia menziesii*, that were grown under elevated CO~2~, despite showing no preference among untreated algae. When offered an assemblage of conspecific algae exposed to a gradient of CO~2~ concentrations, *P. producta* exhibited preference for the treatment that yielded the greatest algal growth in each species (moderate exposure for *E. menziesii* and high exposure for *Laminaria setchellii*). These results suggest that choice is related to experimentally induced changes in algal biochemistry, and further work will examine nutritional and phenolic contents of treated algae to determine the mechanisms underlying the effects of CO~2~ exposure on algal palatability. Elucidating such pathways will lend further support to the findings from these laboratory preference trials, which indicate that ocean acidification has the potential to influence interactions between multiple intertidal grazers and macroalgae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fieber, A.M.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau, P.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

How this increasing prevalence of disease is impacting coral restoration is still unknown. In addition, efforts to restore coral reefs through nursery outplanting are becoming increasingly common, necessitating information on where coral outplants would have the best chance at survival. We studied seven *Acropora cervicornis* outplants from four restoration sites around Little Cayman Island to better understand whether young corals grown in nursery settings were surviving once restored to the wild, and if spatial patterns in their survival were apparent. Presence of disease in the surrounding wild coral reef at these seven restoration sites was also assessed by transect and quadrat based surveys to document the prevalence and type of diseases present at the sites. We found that in spite of the pristine coastal reef ecosystem surrounding Little Cayman Island, outplanted *Acropora cervicornis* were more likely to thrive in deeper fore reef sites than shallower back reef areas. We hypothesize that this spatial pattern in survival among outplants results primarily because there is less algal competition at lower depths due to the lower concentrations of shore derived nutrients and sunlight penetration.  The diseases identified among nearby coral reef genera  provides a baseline for comparison with other reefs that are more heavily impacted by human activities to parse natural and direct human impacts on coral reef health.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gammie, S.A.",1) Humboldt State University 2) Central Caribbean Marine Institute,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eastern Oysters are essential ecosystem engineers. Thus, efforts to restore Eastern Oyster populations in the Chesapeake Bay serve to benefit the entire ecosystem as well as local fisheries and aquaculture. While aquaculture facilities often grow non-reproductive triploid oysters, some farms also grow diploid oysters, which produce gonad and hence can reproduce, in an effort to contribute to natural populations. The ability of diploid oysters grown in aquaculture to contribute to natural populations, however, may depend on their growing conditions. Eastern oysters change sex during their lifetime based on local environmental conditions. However, we have no knowledge of whether the method of growing oysters in aquaculture influences their growth and sex. In Maryland, oyster farmers grow oysters in cages that rest on the bottom of shallow estuaries or in surface floats that are suspended higher in the water column. This experiment aims to test whether the depth at which oysters are raised affects their sex ratios and growth. Using oysters collected from natural reefs and farms throughout Maryland, we found that oyster sex ratios were not affected by culture method; however, culture method affected how males and females grew and allocated energy, including toward reproduction. Considering culture method may, therefore, be a key component in predicting the potential of farmed oysters to contribute to natural populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gavriel, D.","Current address: Department of Biological Sciences: California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, California 90840 USA","Current address: Department of Biological Sciences: Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, Florida 33199 USA","Samara, Y.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Ogburn, M.B.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Breitburg, D.L.","Fisheries Conservation Lab, Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, 647 Contees Wharf Road, Edgewater, Maryland 21037 USA","Donelan, S.C.",,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),,,,

We investigated the natural seasonal growth rates of two morphologically different coralline algal groups from Sitka Sound, Southeast Alaska. In winter and summer of 2018, 76-80 coralline algal samples were collected from the field, stained with Calcein, and outplanted for 2-3 months at the same field site. Once recovered, specimens’ growth rates were quantified using fluorescence microscopy to image linear extension from stained meristematic tissue. In both seasons, the length extension of articulated coralline algae (x̅~W18~=0.18 ± 0.14 mm/month; x̅~S18~=0.22 ± 0.15 mm/month) was greater than that of crustose coralline algae (x̅~W18~=0.13 ± 0.06 mm/month; x̅~S18~=0.10 ± 0.09 mm/month). We estimate slightly more articulated coralline algal biomass added during summer (x̅=1.19 ± 0.04 mg/month) than winter (x̅=1.16 ± 0.04 mg/month), but we were unable to accurately estimate added biomass for crustose forms given our methods.

Considerable variation was found in both constitutive and induced defense in wild chili, which suggests genetic variability in relation to defensive traits.

We discuss our understanding of how primary producer density relates to the abundance of predators within an ecosystem, and whether trophic interactions are similar or different across varying scales and conditions as predator populations fluctuate. In this study, we used temporal and spatial trends of herbivore population dynamics and benthic community structure to evaluate a well-known trophic interaction between otters, urchins, and kelp in Southeast Alaska. We measured the probability of otter presence, sunflower star presence, kelp density, and urchin abundance and size structure at 14 sites in Sitka Sound, AK. We compared these data points to those collected using similar methods in 1988 (otters absent) and 2009 (otters present) by Estes et al. (1995).

Yet, the species assemblage has altered from 1988 to 2018.

Nutrient addition affects the health of corals directly, and also encourages the growth macroalgae which compete with corals for space and resources. Many coral reefs experiencing the effects of eutrophication are adjacent to islands with growing populations and expanding agricultural development. Mo’orea, French Polynesia, is an example of an island which has experienced large population growth and development in the past few decades. One result of this growth has been the conversion of forest to pineapple plantations in some of the island's major watersheds. To assess the effects of land use on coral reef ecosystems we created a time series of land cover change using remote sensing techniques to correspond with time series of coral cover, algal cover and dissolved nutrients collected in the field by the Mo’orea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) program.

While impacts of habitat loss and invasive species on seagrass communities are well-studied, few have considered their combined effects. However, these impacts often co-occur in urban estuaries, and it is unknown whether their effects on seagrass communities interact. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an experiment to assess the combined effects of seagrass habitat loss and invasive Asian mussels (*Arcuatula senhousia*) on infauna communities, as well as the potential for predators to modify *A. senhousia* impacts. We hypothesized that infauna diversity would be lowest in plots with both seagrass disturbance and *A. senhousia* presence due to synergistic effects of habitat loss and competition. We also hypothesized that predators would reduce *A. senhousia* impacts on infauna diversity. We factorially varied disturbance, mussel presence, and predator access in plots in Mission Bay, San Diego in summer 2019. Results to date suggest a trend for lowest diversity in plots with both seagrass loss and Asian mussels; however, diversity was only marginally lower than in plots with seagrass loss only, suggesting that effects of Asian mussels on diversity were limited. Also, diversity was higher in plots with predator access, suggesting that predator effects are stronger than effects of Asian mussel competition.

Placement of artificial nest boxes has contributed to increased nesting activity in urban areas, leading to Bluebirds using “foreign debris” (e.g. plastic) as nesting material, a phenomenon not well described in the literature. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of foreign debris by nesting Western Bluebirds in areas of varying urban development, and measure potential impacts of this behavior on reproductive success. Fifty-seven nest boxes were deployed across areas of vary urbanization (i.e. low, medium, high) and monitored weekly for nesting activity, number of eggs, number and developmental stage of hatchlings, mortality, and foreign debris. At the end of the nesting season, we quantified and categorized all foreign nesting material. Of the nests analyzed to date, 90-100% included at least 1 piece of foreign debris regardless of urbanization level. Nests in areas with low urbanization had an average of 4.7 +/- 1.3 pieces of foreign debris, compared to 14.2 +/- 1.2 pieces and 18.4 +/- 1.6 pieces in areas with medium and high urbanization, respectively. Preliminary analysis also indicates foreign debris may negatively affect fledging success, but results will not be conclusive until all nesting is complete. As human interaction with songbird habitats continues, additional deleterious effects may be observed.

Many species that are native are also endemic. Hawaii ecosystems are venerable to invading species. Two invasive species including the red mangrove, (Rhizophora mangle) and the alga, (Gracilaria Salicornia) seem to be disrupting the habitat for the burrowing shrimp, (Alpheus rapax), and their mutualistic goby, (Psilogobius mainlandi). Although mangroves have been appreciated globally, they have caused problems for species in Hawaii by altering habitat features. Endemic species of Hawaii have not utilized the mangrove habitat. Shrimp/goby burrows appear to be abundant in sandy habitats. However, habitat utilization by the shrimp goby under the mangroves has not been evaluated. To determine if there was a difference in burrow density based on distance from mangroves, we compared burrow density by distance and then tested the effect of mangrove cover removal.

We acclimated wild-caught juvenile opaleye to 20˚C and fed them one of three diets (herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous; consisting of Ulva and/or Artemia). We then used an intermittent flow respirometry system to measure maximum and standard metabolic rate (MMR, SMR), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and aerobic scope. Additionally, we measured growth. We found that diet had significant effects on metabolic performance and growth, with carnivorous diets displaying the highest growth, omnivorous diets conferring the highest SMR and intermediate growth, and herbivorous diets displaying the lowest SMR and no detectable growth.

Sandy beaches, characterized by low primary productivity, are dependent on marine-derived subsidies. Stranded patches of kelp, algae, and seagrasses, referred to as “wrack”, can support diverse invertebrate beach communities that rely on these resources for survival. These communities have been shown to utilize wrack patches differentially in response to a suite of morphological and physiochemical factors that ultimately influence species composition and abundance. To examine changes in beach invertebrate communities driven by the invasive alga, *Sargassum horneri*, wrack and invertebrate surveys were conducted in San Diego during the summer of 2019 and will be conducted again in the spring/summer of 2020. An experimental wrack deployment was also conducted in the summer of 2019 and will be repeated in 2020. Beach hoppers (*Megalorchestia* spp) are dominant wrack grazers and are therefore being treated as a focal group. Differences between communities found in wrack composed of the native *Macrocystis pyrifera* versus *S. horneri* may occur across southern California as the occurrence of *S. horneri* is expected to increase. Beach communities are already exposed to other anthropogenic stressors, resulting in multiple species experiencing regional declines and localized extirpations, further emphasizing the need to understand how *S. horneri* affects sandy beach systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Harrison, L.N.","Department of Biology and Coastal & Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Department of Biology and Coastal & Marine Institute, San Diego State University","Anderson, T.W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, this fishery has been hampered by paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs); failed PST tests causes substantial economic loss to the geoduck fishery through increased sampling costs and by delaying or closing harvests. In the most recent commercial season, 25% of harvestable biomass was left in the ground due to PST closures. Clam toxicity within a harvest area varies substantially from week-to-week, fluctuating well above and below the regulatory limit. Geoduck clams (*Panopea generosa*) are filter feeders and can acquire PSTs by ingesting the toxin-producing phytoplankton, *Alexandrium* sp. Like many dinoflagellate species, *Alexandrium* alternates between a dormant, benthic stage, and a motile vegetative cell. The dormant cyst-stage persists in sediment during commercial clam harvests and we suspect they may influence wintertime toxicity in clams. To better understand the variation of geoduck toxicity, we are investigating spatial and temporal patterns of *Alexandrium* abundance through cyst-mapping. In collaboration with our partners, we collect sediments and clams and have counted high concentrations of cysts (>3000 cysts/cc sediment) in or near harvest areas with recent PST-related closures, as well as directly in the visceral mass of some clams. Uncovering these spatial and temporal patterns of cysts may provide valuable data to managers so that they may mitigate toxicity in commercial clams.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hart, C.E.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,The Sitka Tribe of Alaska Environmental Research Lab,"Lanphier, K.",University of Alaska Southeast,"Shields, M.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Eckert, G.L.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),,,,

The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of techniques known to induce spawning in other bivalve species, but previously unexplored or described only anecdotally in Pismo clams. Multiple methods to induce spawning were tested, including heat stress, exposure to dissected gonadal tissue, and exposure to extracted sperm.

However, recent studies on consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics (CND) have shown that higher trophic level species, such as invertebrate grazers and fish, contribute nutrients via nitrogenous excretion, which can have a positive impact on macroalgal growth. As prior studies have shown metabolism to be negatively impacted by hypercapnia, projected increases in pCO~2~ associated with ocean acidification may limit excretion rates of kelp forest associated species. This experiment investigated the relative nutrient excretion rates of several grazer species and one fish species common within giant kelp forests of Southeast Alaska, where pH levels are expected to decrease by 0.4 units by 2100. Multiple individuals of *Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, Tegula pulligo, Margarites* sp., *Haliotis kamtschatkana, Pagarus* sp., and *Brachyistius frenatus* (N=8/group) were collected from Sitka Sound, AK and incubated in closed containers of UV-sterilized seawater at pH 7.8 and 7.6. Seawater was frozen and analyzed for relative concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, and urea, which were standardized to shell-free dry weight for calcified species and biomass for fish.

In rocky shore systems, predatory sea stars and rock crabs are sympatric predators of California mussels. To examine the effects of these predators on mussels, we combined a field and laboratory experiment to determine (1) the individual and combined effects of crabs and sea stars on mussel mortality, and (2) the effects of the physical and chemical presence of each predator on each other’s feeding behavior. Across three sites varying in predator abundance, the combined effects of crabs and sea stars on mussel mortality did not differ from that of crabs alone. Lab experiments validated our field results in that physically interacting crabs and sea stars did not consume more mussels than crabs alone; suggesting that the physical presence of competitors affected mussel consumption. However, whereas the chemical presence of sea stars had no effect on crabs, we found that the chemical presence of crabs increased the feeding rate of sea stars. Taken together, these results suggest that mussel mortality should be greater in environments where crabs are present versus environments where they are rare or absent, as crabs not only contribute to overall mussel mortality via consumption, but also by increasing the feeding rate of sea stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hull,W.W.",Humboldt State University,Humboldt State University,"Bourdeau,B.E.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

This work aims to assess black abalone status in Baja California to identify critical sites where populations are in good condition. From February 2018 to May 2019, we surveyed 26 sites from the Tijuana border to Faro San José. Preliminary results show cero abalones in 38.5% of the sites, being mainly the northern sites the ones with abalone. Densities were lower than 0.25 abalone/m². Juveniles (< 50mm) and sub-adults (60-90mm) were more abundant, and were found from cero to 1m apart. In contrast, adults (91-120mm) and harvestable size abalones (> 120mm) were very low, and the distance among individuals was > 1m. We found higher densities associated with a moderate habitat.

We tested three different sound treatments (home reef playback, foreign reef playback, and no sound) on two sites (Sites A and B) and collected the zooplankton in a light trap. They were then separated into five general categories: copepods, copepodites, mysids, crab larvae, and ostracod larvae. Our results suggest that adult copepods show significant deterrence from their home reef sound on Site B, and that mysids are attracted to sound with a suggestive trend toward preferring their home reef sounds.

Here we describe the skin microbiome composition of the round stingray, *Urobatis halleri* using shotgun metagenomics. The skin microbiome of fifteen rays was collected from five California locations including Long Beach, San Onofre, Oceanside, San Diego Bay (2019), and Mission Bay (2017).

Preliminary results show Clorobia and Planctomycetia are more abundant on the skin of *Urobatis halleri* than in the water column. At the Class level Gamaproteobacteria are the most abundant on all stingray samples, but there is considerable variation between samples. The proportion of Gamaproteobacteria varies between 36 and 81 % of the metagenome across sting ray microbiomes. In the future, the microbiome from rays will be compared to the microbiomes of sharks and teleost fish. While sharks and rays are related, sharks are covered in dermal denticles with minimal mucus, whereas stingrays have a layer of mucus on their skin, which is a trait more similar to teleost fish. Therefore, we will analyze whether the microbiomes of the two phylogenetically related groups (sharks and rays) is more similar than the two unrelated groups, rays and fish that have a similar mucus-covered skin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kerr, E.N.",San Diego State University,California Department of Fish and Wildlife,"Haggerty, M.",San Diego State University,"Johnson, C.J.",San Diego State University,"Goodman, A.Z.",San Diego State University,"Johri, S.",Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Doane, M.P.",Stanford University,"Morris, M.

We present findings from a study of one small-scale front that forms nearshore, north of Bodega Bay, on the north-central coast of California. We used a Tucker trawl plankton net, CTD profiler, ADCP, satellite imagery, and time-lapse photography to characterize water circulation patterns and plankton distributions within and around the front. Prior work has shown that nearshore topographically-generated fronts provide high-quality feeding patches and enhance larval retention during upwelling. The front we sampled formed only under relaxation conditions and is affected by a collection of physical processes, including flow-separation, beach circulation, and thermal stratification.

There is mounting evidence for the importance of natural enemies (i.e., pathogens and predators) in modifying density dependent vital rates in coral populations, yet the regulatory role of coral predators has rarely been investigated. We conducted a field experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia to explore the effects of predation and colony density on coral growth and survival. We found a negative, density independent effect of predators on coral survival, and a positive, density dependent effect of colony density on coral growth in the absence of predators, but no interaction between these factors. Our study provides insight to the role of predation and colony density in influencing coral vital rates, furthering our understanding of how variable colony density affects coral population dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kopecky, K.

This past year, California experienced above normal levels of rainfall, which coincided with verbal reports of decreased *Undaria pinnatifida* presence in Monterey Harbor and San Francisco Bay. To address the question of whether increased rainfall in California during early 2019 impacted the presence of *Undaria pinnatifida*, we conducted a laboratory culturing experiment that examined the responses of *Undaria pinnatifida* gametophytes to lowered salinity levels. Mature, reproductive adults of *Undaria pinnatifida* were sourced from two locations in California, Monterey Bay and Bodega Bay, and brought back to the Bodega Marine Laboratory where individuals from the two populations separately released spores. Ten replicates of each population’s spore slurry were exposed to five different salinity levels (30, 25, 20, 15, and 10 psu) over a two-month period. We ultimately found differences in growth rates in response to experimental salinity treatments.

The purpose of this project was to mitigate this issue by employing a novel computational approach to analyzing language relationships. We focused on 5 different families of Native Northwest Coast of North America languages, which are important due to their critically endangered and extinct statuses. We compiled a database of a pre-established list of 100 common words (the Swadesh 100 list) in the languages’ respective orthographies, then used a coding system to translate each word into its International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) equivalent. The translated words are treated analogously to DNA sequences; instead of strings of ACGT, we have strings of individual sounds (known as phonemes). The programming system compiles the data to construct phylogenetic trees of the languages. Analysis of the trees may help us to understand how these cultures interacted in the past and to assist with modern day language revitalization efforts. Our preliminary results support known relationships between the languages and have exposed previously unknown relationships. Future research on these languages, in combination with other related data (e.g. genetic and/or geographic), may support the use of this novel computational approach in order to achieve more objective results in the field of linguistics.

Cape Mendocino projects far into the Pacific Ocean, creating strong upwelling and an associated eddy that can potentially force the drifting larvae of intertidal species offshore. In addition, a large sandy stretch of coastline to the north of the Cape gives no opportunities for successful settlement by larvae of rocky intertidal species. The Cape has been identified as a biogeographic break for species with planktonic larval development, but not for direct developers. We first reviewed the literature, finding evidence of phylogeographic structure in 24 out of 46 species that have been sampled across the Cape. We then compared genetic structure across Cape Mendocino in two synchronously diverging, co-distributed intertidal gastropod species: one with planktonic larvae -  *Lottia digitalis* - and another with direct development - *Nucella ostrina.* We hypothesized that if the Cape is a barrier to larval dispersal, *L. digitalis* populations to the north and south of the Cape will show significant genetic divergence, with F~st~ values and divergence times comparable to those found in the non-dispersive *N. ostrina.* Furthermore, populations pairs that do not span the Cape will have F~st~ values close to zero.

In México there is a lack of ecological data, although it is a highly-valuable fisheries resource. The objective of this study was to study the thermoregulation of the black abalone, stablishing the preferred and critical thermal maximum, with the final goal. Forty-five juvenile abalones were obtained from Ensenada, Baja California with an average size of 2.48 cm (0.206 g) and kept at 16°C. The preferred temperature was measured with the gravitational method. Ten organisms were introduced to the gradient at 16°C. Two evaluations each 24-hour were made and their location recorded every hour; obtaining a preferred temperature of 13.8°C. Additionally, to evaluate the CTMax, a glass aquarium (40 L) was used that contained seawater at 16°C, an aeration stone and a 1000-watt heater. Two groups of 10 marked organisms were used to determine their thermotolerance. To assess the exact temperature and the point of detachment from the substrate, we used a methodology of tenacity they were on, a nylon thread was joined to the shell and a lead weight (same weight of each organism was used). The experiment started at 16°C and the temperature increase was 1°C every 15 minutes. The first abalone detached from the substrate was at a temperature of 25.4°C and the last one at 31°C; CTMax of 50% was at 29.7°C.

Parrotfishes target multiple coral species, but have high rates of focused predation on *Orbicella annularis*, an important reef building coral and endangered species. Larger bite scars have far less healing compared to smaller bites; thus greater focused predation leads to greater declines in cover of *O. annularis*. However, it is unclear how reef community composition influences the intensity of predation. The objective of this study is to examine the how the standing stock of bite scars on *O. annularis* corals scales in response to variation in parrotfish biomass and relative corallivore density,  total coral cover and relative *O. annularis* cover, and well as algae community composition. We surveyed: 1) the size and abundance of bite scars in relation to  *O. annularis* cover, 2) the relative cover of coral species, macroalgae species and other functional groups commonly targeted by parrotfishes using benthic photoquadrats, and 3) the  biomass and community composition of parrotfish species using roving diver surveys. Preliminary results show that the intensity of corallivory changed in response to site-level differences in the community composition of parrotfishes and benthic cover.

By quantifying sea otter diets and caloric intake according to recolonization patterns, we can better understand the ecosystem impacts of sea otter population increase and range expansion. We hypothesized that sea otter diet will vary according to age, reproductive class, seasonality, and time since recolonization. Foraging data was collected around Prince of Wales Island to determine diet composition during the summer. Sea otter vibrissae were obtained from subsistence hunters to assess seasonal changes in sea otter diets by using bulk stable isotope analysis. Sea otter prey items were collected in three seasons (spring, summer, and winter) to measure caloric value and stable isotopes of carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N). Sea otter diets show variation over various metrics, but the overall population-level diet composition consisted of 69% of the biomass from clams, with butter clams as the main clam species. The results of this study aids in the future management of shellfisheries, subsistence hunting, and co-management of a protected species by providing quantitative diet composition data for stakeholders.

The European green crab (*Carcinus maenas*) is invasive on the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, and has the potential to impact shellfish aquaculture in the area by consuming product. We conducted a feeding experiment to determine whether *C. maenas* modifies its predatory behaviour when exposed to the effluent of the native red rock crab *Cancer productus*, which is a known predator and competitor. To determine whether *C. maenas* could have a disproportionate effect on cultured Pacific oysters (*Crassostrea gigas*) over a native predator, we also used functional response experiments to compare the predatory behaviour of *C. maenas* and *C. productus*. We found no effect of effluent on the feeding rate of *C. maenas*, suggesting that any exclusion by *C. productus* is not a result of chemical cues. We also found that predation by *C. maenas* increased asymptotically (Type II functional response) when fed increasing densities of *C. gigas*, while *C. productus* displayed a sigmoidal (Type III) response. Thus, at high prey densities we expect these two species will have comparable predation effects on *C. gigas* populations, despite *C. productus*’s considerably larger size. We predict that *C. maenas* will have a larger, potentially destabilizing, impact on low densities of *C. gigas*.

Site differed in wave exposure supplies different levels of oceanic properties to the community. Phytoplankton were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and relative abundance was estimated. We found that phytoplankton communities were similar in all kelp forests. There was also a transition from diatoms to dinoflagellates that corresponded with changes in upwelling patterns. While community composition was similar the abundance of phytoplankton was different inside and outside the kelp forests. This was indicated by higher amounts of chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon (POC) outside of the kelp forest. When similar levels of productivity are observed inside and outside of kelp forests, they are likely driven by different primary producers.

White abalone (*Haliotis sorenseni*) was the first marine invertebrate listed as endangered via the US Endangered Species Act. To recover this species, a consortium of partners led by UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) breeds white abalone in captivity for outplanting in the wild. BML’s Captive Breeding Program has increased production of animals to outplanting size from merely a few dozen animals to thousands of animals annually in the past six years. However, production is at least an order of magnitude behind of what is necessary to save this species. In order to increase production, it is critical to understand variation in survival. The highest mortality in captive-bred abalone occurs in the first three months. Most effort has been dedicated to increasing survival at that stage; however, little attention has been given to mortality at older life history stages. Insights about mortality at these stages would optimize culture operations and inform stocking strategies. We investigated the mortality of 1- to 3-year-old white abalone grown at BML from 2016-2019. Mortality varied by animal age, spawning year, and parentage. These results can be used to identify strategies for increasing captive white abalone production for outplanting, expediting species recovery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"McNealy, J.L.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Aquilino, K.M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,

However, recent literature has suggested that photosynthetic organisms including macroalgae and seagrass could provide refugia for shellfish by modifying seawater chemistry, thus buffering the effects of OA. In this study the Pacific oyster *Crassotrea gigas* was incubated in laboratory chambers in the presence and absence of the seagrass *Zostera marina*. Incubations were conducted with both ambient (400 μatm) and elevated CO~2~ seawater (1200 μatm) and ran in both light and dark periods. Rates of calcification for oysters were measured using changes in seawater total alkalinity. The presence of seagrass appeared to enhance calcification of the oysters in ambient seawater and light treatments. However, in contrast to our hypothesis and previous studies, seagrass did not increase calcification in the elevated CO~2~ treatments. Changes in seawater chemistry produced by seagrass may not have been sufficient to counteract the negative effects of OA on oyster calcification, therefore additional analyses are planned that will investigate this possibility. Results from this study enhance our understanding of how seagrasses influence the performance of calcifying organisms, but more research is needed to elucidate the buffering capability of seagrass in response to future climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Merolla, S.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Outcalt, A.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Ricart, A.M.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Sanford, E.D.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Gaylord, B.P.","Bodega Marine Laboratory - University of California, Davis","Hill, T.M.",,,,,,,6,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid climate change can induce this type of eco-evolutionary response, however there must be standing genetic and phenotypic variation for selection to act upon. We tested whether different strains of an important microalgal endosymbiont, *Symbiodinium microadriaticum*, responded differently to environmental stress. We cultured five strains of *S. microadriaticum* at three temperatures, 26°C, 30°C, and 32°C, and measured growth rate, respiration, and photosynthesis. Strains responded differently to thermal stress, suggesting existing standing variation that could allow for evolutionary rescue. This is a preliminary investigation into the potential for evolutionary rescue by association in cnidarian-dinoflagellate obligate mutualisms. Most work on evolutionary rescue considers a single species, however, species interactions need also be considered when investigating evolutionary responses to climate change. Specifically, evolutionary rescue by association could occur if a mutualist is able to rapidly evolve and rescue the holobiont, without necessitating evolution in the host itself.

In California, this habitat is also home to the federally endangered black abalone, *Haliotis cracherodii*, an important herbivorous gastropod whose populations suffered from withering syndrome related mass-mortality in the 1980s. At five sites on Santa Cruz Island, CA, intertidal populations of both species were monitored annually in permanent survey plots from 2014 to 2019. Coincident with observed coast-wide mass-mortality, densities of *P. ochraceus* fell to zero or near zero at all five study locations by mid 2014, with negligible recovery and no evidence of significant recruitment over the next five years.

MULTIPLE SOURCES OF EELGRASS IN RESTORATION MAY HEDGE BETS IN HIGHLY VARIABLE SAN FRANCISCO BAY,"Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is valued in temperate estuaries throughout the world for services including stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for invertebrates, fishes, and birds. Eelgrass beds in San Francisco Bay have been damaged due to fill, boating, and pollutants. We have been conducting experiments to determine how best to restore eelgrass. Restoration efforts beginning in 2014 were designed to include experimental tests of donor source, replicated across sites and years. Following site selection using a habitat suitability model, we use small “test plots” to test site suitability, then expand plantings into multiple half-acre plots in which rows of transplants differ by donor (natural eelgrass beds where the plants were collected), or contain a mix of all donor sources. Preliminary results show strong effects of both donor source and year. At a site near Sausalito, plants from the closest natural bed have resulted in the greatest spatial coverage in some years. However, in other years, a further source gives the greatest coverage, suggesting that conditions in a particular year (e.g., temperature and salinity) matter. Interestingly, the mixture of sources is proving best at hedging bets, as it always contains the source that is most successful in a given year. In addition to spatial metrics, we are evaluating whether source and year interact to influence other characteristics, including densities, flowering rates, and invertebrate use. These data will inform future recommendations on whether to mix or match donors with site conditions in eelgrass restoration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Patten, M.

Its distributional pattern suggests that temperature and salinity play important roles in limiting its distribution. However, because other factors often covary with temperature and salinity, drawing strong conclusions from these patterns is difficult. In an effort to more clearly identify the effects of these factors, we examined tolerance to acute thermal (16-28°C) and salinity (0-35 psu) stress by larvae (5-day exposure, unfed) and adults (14-day exposure, unfed) of *F. enigmaticus* in laboratory experiments. Larvae showed higher mortality at the highest temperature tested, 28°C; adult survival was unaffected by temperature. Neither larvae nor adults survived exposure to pure freshwater (0 psu), but survived well at salinities ranging from 3.5-35 psu. In addition, high salinity did not slow tube growth in adults. These results suggest that salinity stress, in particular, is not directly responsible for the frequent limitation of *F. enigmaticus* to low-salinity habitats. Experimental work on the causes of the distribution of *F. enigmaticus* is uncommon in the literature, but is likely needed to identify the abiotic or biotic factors that limit the distribution of this frequently invasive species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Peria,J.N.","California State University, Northridge","California State University, Long Beach","Pernet,B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,,,,

Oysters are historically abundant animals that are commonly targeted for Living Shorelines for their added benefit of filtering water. Concrete mixed with natural materials, such as shell, formed into a dome-shape structure with holes, called a reef ball, can be used as hard substratum to promote the growth and recruitment of oysters. We are investigating whether modifying the concrete shell composition and surface texture can preferentially recruit and promote the growth of native Olympia oysters, *Ostrea lurida*, and discourage the recruitment and growth of non-native Pacific oysters, *Crassostrea gigas*. We deployed four treatment types with surface shell (crushed and full shell) or without shell (smooth and rough concrete). The full shell and rough concrete surface had added surface texture to investigate the effect of rugosity on the recruitment of oysters. Seven replicates per treatment were deployed in San Diego Bay, CA, at 0 m MLLW from May to September 2018. We measured oyster growth and recruitment and found that *O. lurida* recruited in higher numbers than *C. gigas* on all treatments, but *C. gigas* had a higher percent cover than *O. lurida* on all treatments due to its larger size. Neither species showed a treatment preference.

The topography of the island creates distinct watersheds, each of which flows out onto a distinct fringing reef area. The island’s population and agricultural activities lie mainly in watersheds on the north shore, leaving the east and west shore of the triangular island less developed. This creates a unique opportunity to study and compare the effect of a range of land use, and subsequent watershed health, on the structure of fringing reef communities. To do this we collected dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and total suspended solids data from 2017 to 2019 for nine nearshore watersheds in rainy and dry seasons. In August 2019, we conducted transects at fringing reef sites near the river mouths of these watersheds. These transects were conducted from the river mouth outwards, along a gradient of river plume exposure. Along these transects, we created an inventory of macroalgae species. With this inventory, we have examined macroalgal species richness at each site in comparison to river nutrient and sediment data. Using this relationship, we investigated macroalgae as a possible bioindicator of nutrient enrichment and identified species associated with higher nutrient levels in the adjacent river.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pierce, K.M.",UC Santa Barbara,UC Santa Barbara,"Neumann, K.C.",UC Santa Barbara,"Burkepile, D.E.",Université de la Polynésie Française,"Zubia, M.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

Unlike many other kelp species, *Nereocystis* is an annual species that shows high seasonal and interannual variability, with recruitment, growth and survival influenced by multiple abiotic and biotic drivers. To understand the interannual dynamics of *Nereocystis*, we’ve developed a monitoring program with three objectives: 1) empirically quantify *Nereocystis* productivity, 2) determine the morphometric properties driving productivity, and 3) understand the abiotic and biotic drivers of *Nereocystis* productivity in space and time.The measurements for *Nereocystis* are new and parameter standards, to date, have not been established. We present trends from three years of seasonal surveys at three sites on the Central Coast of British Columbia. First, multiple *Nereocystis* demographics exhibit seasonal trends and inform modelled estimates of productivity. Second, dynamics of *Nereocystis* blades and stipes both contribute substantially to productivity. Finally, abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature and nutrients) contribute differentially to *Nereocystis* dynamics across months, years and sites.

Historically ecologists have focused on variation in traits among species; however, more recent studies have documented that variation in traits within a species can meet or exceed the effects of variation among species. While the consequences of intraspecific variation are mainly researched when documenting such consequences in predator-prey interactions, this intraspecific variation is not as well-studied when considering its effects on mutualisms between species.  Here we study how intraspecific variation in a coral-guard crab (*Trapezia serenei*) affects its capacity to defend *Pocillopora* corals from predatory sea stars. We subjected guard crabs to a series of behavioral tests to catalog variation in aggressive behavior among individuals and then used a mesocosm study to estimate how intraspecific variation in aggressive behaviors were linked to their capacity to deter coral predation. We found that behavioral variation in *T. serenei* significantly affected the intensity of coral predation where corals containing crabs with more aggressive temperaments lost less coral tissue to predation. This study successfully shows the importance of considering individual trait variation in mutualisms and indicates that including intraspecific variation in our studies of mutualisms can allow us to explain variation that has historically been considered noise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Primo, A","University of California, Santa Barbara",McMaster University,"Pruitt, J.N.",University of Georgia,"Osenberg, C.W.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Stier, A.C.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

The Los Angeles Harbor breakwall is an artificial reef that provides a high relief rocky reef structure which has relatively consistent habitat features across a depth gradient from the surface typically down to 15 or 20 meters where the quarry rock meets a sandy bottom. Garibaldi (Hypsypops rubicundus) is a protected marine damselfish found in southern California from 0-25m in depth. Territorial males prepare and defend a nest consisting of different red algae to attract females. Previous studies have indicated that females prefer nests with higher area of dense turf algae. Here we examine depth specific patters of Garibaldi habitat use and nest characteristics, as an initial part of an investigation of habitat quality of natural and artificial rocky reefs. We used a scuba diver operated stereo-video system to collect data on fish size structure, density, nest, and habitat characteristics across a depth gradient, and to determine if there is a correlation between male body size and nest area. We also used more traditional scuba-based survey methods to sample nest algal composition, and other nest and general habitat characteristics to compare techniques to quantify reef characteristics. Data from Los Angeles Harbor breakwall indicates that Garibaldi size structure varies with depths, and that these differences are correlated with multiple nest characteristics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pyles, A.M.","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","California State Polytechnic University, Pomona","Claisse, J.T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

Past studies indicate that these disturbances can trigger mass mortality of intertidal invertebrates, including important sessile foundation species such as mussels. However, little is known regarding how mortality of mussels influences the diverse communities that live within mussel beds. In this study, we documented the extent and community consequences of mass mortality of California mussels (*Mytilus californianus*) in association with a record-breaking heatwave that struck northern California during June 2019. We surveyed the percentage of mussel mortality in randomly placed quadrats in Bodega Marine Reserve and compared the abundance and composition of invertebrates within plots with a low versus high percentage of dead mussel shells. Mean mortality of mussels in the upper layer of the bed was 30.4% in the high zone, and 24.1% in the mid zone. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index did not differ between plots with a high percentage of dead mussels and those with a low percentage of dead mussels; however, the plots with a high percentage of dead mussels had a lower species richness and a lower total abundance of invertebrates. These results demonstrate that heatwaves can have immediate, negative effects on mussel bed communities, although additional research is needed to examine rates of recovery and the longer-term impacts of these extreme events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quan, J.R.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","De Leon Sanchez, E.E.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Longman, E.K.","Bodega Marine Reserve, University of California, Davis","Sones, J.L.","Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis","Sanford, E.",,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

Mussels were collected from three locations in HB: North Bay (NB), Entrance Bay (EB), and South Bay (SB). Oysters were purchased from a commercial oyster farmer who cultivates them in the NB. Bivalves were digested with proteolytic enzyme complexes, vacuum filtered, and MP were quantified by microscopic examination of filters. All samples contained MP, with plastic fibers being the most abundant items. Significantly different concentrations of MP (plastic particles/g tissue wet mass) were found between mussels collected from different locations and from the cultured oysters (p = 0.000). Mussels from NB contained the highest average concentration of MP and were significantly different from all other groups. MP concentrations in EB and SB mussels were intermediate, and oysters contained the lowest concentrations. Half of the samples from each location were digested using the enzyme complex Corolase 7089, and the other half were digested with Corolase 8000. No significant difference in MP recovery was found between the two treatments (p=0.253). All samples treated with Corolase 8000 digested completely, whereas some of the samples treated with Corolase 7089 did not achieve complete digestion, suggesting that Corolase 8000 is more efficient for this purpose.

"Reed, Kiran",,kiran.reed.920@my.csun.edu,,,,,Behavioral mechanisms underlying parasite-mediated competition for refuges in a coral reef fish,"Parasites have been increasingly recognized as contributors to indirect ecological interactions, mainly through the process of host-manipulation. In our study system, the bridled goby host species (Coryphoptererus glaucofraenum) is infected by a parasitic copepod (Pharodes tortugensis) that attaches to its gills. We tested for a trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII) where predator-prey contact between Coryphoptererus glaucofraenum and predatory fish is modified by Pharodes tortugensis. Because this particular parasite is not trophically transmitted via host manipulation, the altered behaviors in parasitized gobies are instead likely coincidental to infection. Gobies compete for crevices in the reef to avoid predation and it has been previously shown that goby mortality increases more rapidly with refuge shortage for parasitized gobies than for their parasite-free counterparts. We found interactive effects of refuge shortage and parasitism on two behaviors we predicted might be associated with parasite-mediated competition for refuges. First, as refuges became scarce, the rate of aggression among gobies increased and parasitism intensified this interaction. Second, as refuges became scarce goby proximity to them increased, but parasitism nullified this response. In combination, these parasite-induced behavioral alterations may explain why parasitized gobies are poorer competitors for refuges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Reed, K","California State University, Northridge",University of Rhode Island,"Forrester, G",University of Rhode Island,"Chille, E",University of Rhode Island,"Nickles, K",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,,,,

We collected “healthy” (green) and “necrotic” (green with black/ brown lesions) blades from the fore, mid and back bay (n=10 each site/blade type). In the lab, half of each blade was cultured on SSW media to detect *Labyrinthula* spp., and the other dried for DNA extraction and qPCR to quantify *Labyrinthula* spp. Excess Green Index (EGI) image analysis was used as a proxy for plant health. Both “healthy” and “necrotic” blades were positive for *Labyrinthula* spp. in culture at all three sites. qPCR results (2018 samples) also confirmed *Labyrinthula* spp. on both blade types at all sites, with the greatest concentration observed in the back bay. EGI analysis showed no consistent correlation between number of parasites and severity of lesions. The ubiquitous distribution and EGI results suggest that the *Labyrinthula* spp. in Morro Bay Estuary may not be a primary pathogen, but instead is an opportunist.

Southern California beaches serve as a juvenile white shark nursery habitat, and year-round human recreation areas.  Evidence of increasing white shark population in northeastern Pacific Ocean, along with rising popularity of beach-related recreation may increase human-shark encounter probability. Although white shark bite rates have not risen, increased sightings and public fear of white sharks can negatively affect coastal tourism. Developing an understanding of nearshore recreation distributions, and quantification of human-white shark encounter rates may reduce beach safety concerns.

Similarly, the nature of the disturbance (e.g. vegetation removal versus trampling by observers) could influence community recovery. Currently, however, our understanding of the lasting effects of experiments is lacking. We followed the recovery of experimental plots after the aboveground biomass was harvested at the completion of a 3-year manipulation of burrowing crabs in two southern California salt marshes. We surveyed crab burrows and vegetation in four plot types: 1) crab exclosures, 2) crab enclosures, 3) trampled areas surrounding exclosures/enclosures, and 4) undisturbed controls. At both marshes, burrow densities differed between treatments 1 & 2 even one year after cage removal. However, this did not translate into differences in the recovery of vegetation between these plots. Also, trampling decreased burrow density, perhaps because it shifted the community towards mud with a greater water content. But these trampling impacts were only seen at one marsh. Importantly, even after one year, experimental and trampled plots were less vegetated than controls. Thus, the recovery of salt marshes following experimental manipulations that included harvesting aboveground plant biomass may take longer than one year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Richardson, P.J.",SDSU,SDSU/UC Davis,"Walker, J.K.",SDSU,"Long, J.D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In temperate reefs along the California coast, the clonal corallimorpharian *Corynactis californica* provides an associational refuge to macroalgae from benthic grazers such as sea urchins. *C. californica* exhibit striking variation amongst colonies – in color, morphology, physiology, and behavior – and yet we have a limited understanding of how such variation may influence the ability of *C. californica* to defend macroalgae from grazing pressure. Here, I studied how trait variation among *C. californica* colonies influences purple urchin (*Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus*) foraging on giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*). I placed urchins in aquaria with one of three color morphs of *C. californica* and measured kelp consumption as well as urchin behavior. Overall, the presence of *C. californica* reduced kelp consumption by urchins and increased the time it took urchins to reach kelp. While urchins were least likely to consume kelp in the presence of red color morphs, the strength of the effect of *C. californica* on urchin behavior differed amongst color morphs. These findings suggest the role of intraspecific trait variation in positive interactions between *C. californica*  and macroalgae may be subtle and warrants further study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ritger, A.L.","University of California, Santa Barbara","University of California, Santa Barbara","Stier, A.C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

Surveyors walked the entirety of the islands and identified individual cactus. All parameters collected through field work were compared to those collected using UAVs. Preliminary analysis shows UAVs can correctly identify 100% of *F. gatesii* greater than 18 cm in diameter, while also identifying reproductive status.

Three wildlife tunnels were built over a decade ago underneath Valley Center Road, a busy highway next to the Daley Ranch conservation area in Escondido, CA. These tunnels serve as a corridor between Daley Ranch and Lake Wohlford, two habitats that provide essential resources to the local wildlife. The San Diego Tracking Team (SDTT) has performed quarterly surveys of wildlife observations within these tunnels since 2010. We have analyzed the results of these surveys to analyze how wildlife observations in the tunnels have changed from 2010 - 2018, and if wildlife tended to prefer one tunnel over the other tunnels. It was found that there was no significant difference in the quantity of observations of each species between the three tunnels. There was, however, a significant difference in the quantity of observations of each species from year to year. Although track surveys provide insight into wildlife use of the tunnels, there are several limitations with this method. We propose the use of camera traps in the tunnels to gain a better understanding of how wildlife behave in the tunnels, when they use the tunnels, and how many individuals use the tunnels. We also hope the camera traps will provide further insight as to how often humans are present in the tunnels.

"Schouweiler, Megan",,mschouwe@ucsc.edu,,,,,EFFECTS OF PH AND TEMPERATURE ON THE EXCRETION RATE AND NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF KELP FOREST GRAZER FECES,"Herbivorous invertebrate species are the primary consumers of macroalgae in kelp forest environments. These species excrete large quantities of digested, nutrient-rich material as feces, creating a nutritional subsidy for benthic detritivores that are unable to directly consume larger, intact material. As ocean environments are predicted to become warmer and more acidic, this fecal supply may decrease as the primary grazers extract nutrients more efficiently to cope with changing conditions. This study focused on the fecal output of three common species of grazers in Southeast Alaska’s giant kelp forests: green and red urchins, (*Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis* and *Strongylocentrotus franciscanus*) and pinto abalone, (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*). Twelve individuals from each species were collected from Sitka Sound, AK, placed in separate tanks with flow-through seawater and fed a diet of fresh *Macrocystis pyrifera* to satiation. Consumption and excretion rates for each invertebrate were quantified in ambient conditions (12°C, 8.0 pH) and in increased temperature and acidity (15°C, 7.6 pH). Algal and fecal samples collected during both trials were analyzed for differences in caloric content and carbon:nitrogen ratios to quantify relative nutritional quality.

Often, introduced species reduce the abundance and diversity of biota in recipient food webs. However, ontogenetic diet shifts in the introduced species can alter the presence, degree or direction of these impacts on native species, making it difficult for scientists and managers to predict the ecological consequences of species introductions. I conducted a manipulative field experiment to assess the effects of crayfish species identity and ontogenetic stage on benthic invertebrate composition and abundance as well as leaf litter breakdown by native signal crayfish (*Pacifastacus leniusculus*) and introduced ringed crayfish (*Faxonius neglectus neglectus*). Treatments with signal crayfish and adult crayfish had higher reductions in leaf litter relative to treatments with introduced crayfish and juvenile crayfish. Alpha and beta diversity of benthic invertebrates was similar among treatments, but there were fewer shredders in treatments with adult crayfish. Thus, I show that ontogenetic stage and native vs. non-native status both matter for understanding the impact of species introductions on local ecological communities and ecosystem processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Segui, L.M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kelp forests may provide refuge for organisms experiencing upwelling, characterized by low oxygen content and cold temperatures. As the climate continues to change, these upwelling events are predicted to intensify, thus raising concerns and questions about how organisms will respond to these new conditions. Here, we tested the effects of hypoxia on the heart rate (which can be used as a proxy for metabolism) and consumption rate of Panulirus interruptus (California Spiny Lobster). We exposed lobsters to either hypoxic (<50% air saturation (AS)) or normoxic (>90% AS) conditions for 24 hours and measured its effects on lobster 1) consumption rate of local mussel, Mytilus spp. and 2) heart rate. Hypoxia caused a noticeable decrease in consumption rate (of mussels over 24 hours) across all individuals as compared to individuals held in normoxic conditions. Preliminary results suggest that there was little difference in heart rate across individuals exposed to hypoxia versus individuals exposed to normoxia. These results suggest that severe upwelling and climate change associated hypoxia events may alter the feeding behavior of California spiny lobsters.

Concurrent with elevated water temperature during the recent ENSO in southern California, *Sargassum horneri*, an invasive brown alga, increased dramatically. To determine if growth of *S. horneri* varies with temperature and if this variation can be masked by herbivory, we are monitoring temperature and thalli growth +/- access to herbivores on Catalina Island. Twice a month we collect 20 *S. horneri* in each of 3 size classes (≤10cm, >10cm & ≤100cm, and >100cm), weigh and measure height, attach half inside cages and leave half open to herbivory. Algae and a temperature logger are deployed for 5 days then collected, remeasured, and reweighed. Deployments will be repeated September-April to capture a wide range of temperatures. We will evaluate the relationship between temperature and growth both with and without herbivores. We expect *S. horneri* will maintain growth above temperatures known to result in *Macrocystis pyrifera* decline (20ºC), but this growth can be masked by herbivory. Preliminary results for September show *S. horneri* ≤10cm grew taller when caged, but did not change weight. *S. horneri* between 10 & 100cm had grew in weight and height, with no difference between herbivore treatments.

Even when the catch of this marine resource is carried out under a regulated quota scheme, in order to ensure sustainability, its is currently classified as “vulnerable” by the IUCN. The Gulf Corvina fishery has been always directed to the breeding aggregations, during the migration of mature individuals to the UGC, so the low genetic diversity revealed by some early studies raised up the concern on the conservation status of this endemic species. A more recent study pointed out that even when the species went into a population bottleneck before the onset of the fishery, the effective population size is large enough and do not compromise its persistence on the short-term. To confirm this demographic scenario and infer the trends on population abundance we analyzed 1,506 individuals collected over the last decade to test for changes in the frequency and number of maternal lineages (maternal haplotypes). Our results do not show significant differences in genetic diversity between the 2009 and 2019 fishing seasons, but confirmed that the Gulf Corvina has lower genetic diversity than other Corvina species that inhabit the UGC and even less that in the Totoaba, another endemic species of the UGC considered as critically endangered.

Mounting position of acoustic receivers in the water column can impact detection efficiency due to factors such as refraction and reflection of the transmitted signal. A limitation of passive acoustic telemetry is often the rate at which data is obtained. Because subsurface-mounted receivers must be removed from their moorings and downloaded on the surface, time of data acquisition intervals may be months or more. Vemco real-time receiver buoys address this issue by providing real-time data via cell-networks. To have a rugged design that can withstand a potentially harsh marine-deployment, receivers must be mounted directly to the subsurface frame of a buoy. Cabled, digital receivers (VR2Rx) mounted to buoys were tested for detection efficiency and range in comparison with subsurface VR2W receivers. Range tests suggest that despite the buoy-mounted receiver being located near the surface (1 m) and VR2AR/VR2W receiver at depth (6 m), the performance between receivers was not significantly different. Subsurface receivers performed marginally better at close range (200-305 m), while the VR2Rx performed marginally better at far range (410, 565 m). Given the added benefit of real-time data combined with minimal reductions in detection efficiency, real-time buoys appear to be an important new tool in the field of acoustic telemetry. Because data acquisition is recorded and stored in real-time via cloud service, these systems are more cost and data efficient than VR2Ws.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stirling, B.S.","California State University, Long Beach","California State University, Long Beach","Anderson, J.M.","California State University, Long Beach","Lowe, C.G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,

Juvenile English sole use coastal estuaries as a nursery habitat, which unfortunately is susceptible to anthropogenic stressors, such as eutrophication. Hypoxia, the deficiency of oxygen, causes an increase in ventilation rate. This increase can result in vulnerability to predators and an increase in energy exertion, which negatively affects its survivability. Six treatments of dissolved oxygen(DO) were set up in twelve tanks containing ten fish each. After two weeks, the acclimated fish(n=60) were tested in trials of two tanks per treatment with five fish per tank in an array of ten experimental chambers made of 1.5cm thick polypropylene sheet. By counting operculum movements on GoPro footage, the ventilation rate is estimated from averaging between three one-minute measurements from start, halfway, and finish of the 30-minute recording. We expect to see a linear pattern of increased ventilation rate as DO decreases. Alternatively, the ventilation rate may stay constant and rapidly increase at a lower standard. This data will serve as a reference in determining the long-term effects hypoxia has on English sole population and how its nursery habitat can be protected from anthropogenic stressors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Switzer, Ethan.R",CSU Monterey Bay,Moss Landing Marine Labs,Helaina Lindsey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These systems attempt to mimic real-world conditions while altering variables such as temperature and pH in order to simulate climate change in a controlled setting. While mesocosm experiments represent a viable approach to this area of research, their implementation is often quite costly and can be inaccessible to those without substantial funding. One particularly expensive aspect is the control of experimental treatments using high-cost sensors and controller units. This project highlights a cost-effective solution for monitoring mesocosm treatments (temperature and pH, in a study of eelgrass and grazing response) through the use of DIY Arduino micro-controllers. Controllers were programmed to monitor and maintain the temperature and pH of four 55-gal header tanks at set intervals above or below the incoming seawater (+3^oC above ambient/-0.3 pH units below ambient). This allows treatment tanks to experience the same daily fluctuations as the ambient seawater, while common controllers are often restricted to static treatment values. Due to their low cost, accuracy (+/- 0.002), and general flexibility, controllers built using Arduino and accessory components are a viable way of reducing the overall cost of mesocosm experiments focused on climate change. This can in turn make studies of this nature more accessible, while maintaining highly accurate treatment levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tettelbach, C.R.H.","Estuary & Ocean Science Center, San Francisco State University",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,

Current conservation efforts include outplanting cultured abalone to enhance wild populations. However, one challenge to the success of these efforts is the high risk of predation on captive-bred abalone, which are naïve to predators. This study aimed to investigate whether cultured white abalone exhibit defense responses when exposed to a predator, if those defenses allow the abalone to escape, and whether the abalone escape more quickly after multiple encounters. In a laboratory experiment, cultured white abalone were exposed to a predator, the Giant Spined Star (*Pisaster giganteus*), over three consecutive five-minute trials. The type and duration of abalone behaviors were recorded throughout each trial, and then compared to those observed during a control trial where abalone were touched by a non-biological sponge, as well as a baseline trial with no stimulus applied. The abalone altered their behavior when exposed to *P. giganteus* relative to control and baseline trials, effectively breaking contact with the sea star by twisting (i.e., successive rotation of the shell) and galloping (i.e., rapid directional movement). They also escaped more quickly  after the initial trial. These results indicate that cultured white abalone have an innate ability to recognize and respond to predators, and they can learn to escape more effectively  through repeated encounters with predators. Predator exposure in the laboratory prior to outplanting may thus improve their survival in the wild",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thomasdotter, A.O.",San Jose State University,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","Marks, L.","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service","Neuman, M.","University of California, Santa Barbara","Beltran, N.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the impacts of crustose coralline algae (CCA), a known promoter of coral settlement, and the encrusting brown alga *Ramicrusta textilis*, an aggressive space competitor, on settlement and subsequent survival of a Caribbean gorgonian *Plexaura homomalla*. Planulae were given six days to choose between three pieces of coral rubble, which were mostly covered with CCA or *Ramicrusta* (“CCA” or “Ram”), or mostly not covered with algae (“Bare”). Settlement was greatest on CCA rubble, lower on Ram rubble, and lowest on Bare rubble. Within patches on each piece of rubble, polyps highly preferred CCA patches, showed no preference or avoidance for bare patches, and strongly avoided *R. textilis*. Survival was not different between rubble types but was significantly different between patch types. After 20 days, survival was highest on bare patches (79%), lower on CCA patches (61%), and lowest on *R. textilis* patches (41%). Presence of crust encourages nearby settlement, regardless of crust type, but patch type is a more important factor in determining subsequent survival.

However, the low growth rate and sensitivity to high water temperatures still represent important bottlenecks in the production. Interspecific hybridization between abalone species with different thermal windows has the potential to overcome these limitations, improving growth rates even at high temperatures. In this regard, RNA-seq data provide a valuable resource to identify the physiological mechanism underlying the better performance of hybrids. In this study, we describe the growth in juveniles of pure *H. rufescens* (RR) and a hybrid cross of RR with *H. corrugata* (RAm) following three months acclimation at 18°C and 22°C. To evaluate the gene expression patterns, we constructed a reference transcriptome assembly using RR and RAm samples from each temperature. Our results show a lower growth rate of RR at 22 °C than at 18 °C, whereas RAm growth was similar in both temperatures and to RR at 18 °C. The RNA-seq data confirms different expression patterns between warm-acclimated RR and RAm. However, a differential expression analysis between the 22 °C and 18 °C treatments from each cross evinced that RAm presented a higher proportion of down-regulated genes involved in catalytic activity and cellular metabolic processes. Together, these results suggest that hybrid abalone can compensate for increased temperature following different gene regulation strategies than the pure cross, allowing it to sustain growth performance even after three months of warm acclimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tripp-Valdez, M.

We examined whether resistance and tolerance decreased in cultivated chilies serrano and poblano, in relation to wild chiltepín chili. To examine tolerance, we inflicted damage of 0%, 25% and 50% on leaves of wild and domesticated chilies. Tolerance was quantified as relative growth rate (RGR), chlorophyll and biomass allocation. Resistance measurements were leaf total phenolic content, trichomes density and survival and performance of an herbivore larval. Wild chili showed no changes between treatments on tolerance traits indicating full tolerance, whereas plants with 50% damage declined heterogeneously on RGR and fruit biomass on serrano and poblano plants, respectively. Resistance was higher in wild than in cultivated varieties. Larvae fed with wild chili leaves had a 0% survival, while a 73.33% survival was found on larvae fed with domesticated varieties. A reduction of total phenolic content was observed on 50% damaged plants of wild and poblano chili. Leaf trichome density increased only in serrano with 50% damage.

Parental effects, where offspring responses to environmental change are influenced by environments experienced by parents, may include mechanisms of coping with thermal stress. This study evaluated the degree to which thermal tolerance of larvae of the mussel, *Mytilus trossulus*, is influenced by parental environments. Adult mussels were collected from two sites of varying thermal stress on San Juan Island, WA: Friday Harbor Laboratories dock (FHL; low stress subtidal population) and False Bay (FB; high stress intertidal population). Air, water, and body temperatures were recorded in the field, and LT~50~ thermal tolerance (temperature lethal to 50% of individuals) trials were conducted on field-collected adults and their veliger larvae raised in the laboratory. Environmental temperatures and in situ mussel body temperatures were higher at False Bay (Mann-Whitney: p<0.001). Thermal tolerance was slightly higher in adults from the high stress environment than those from the low stress site. Despite predictions that larvae are more vulnerable and rarely experience such high temperatures in the water column, larval tolerances were surprisingly high when exposed to only one hour of elevated temperatures. In addition, larval tolerances were not significantly different between sites (T-Test; p=0.2424). These results raise questions about the role of parental effects in thermal tolerance and vulnerability to thermal stress across ontogeny.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Waite, H.R.",University of California Irvine,University of California Irvine,"Sorte, C.J.B.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,,,,
"Waldschmidt, Alexandra",,ajwaldschmidt@gmail.com,,,,,PINTO ABALONE CRYPTIC BEHAVIOR IN RELATION TO THEIR SIZE AND HABITAT COMPLEXITY IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA,"Pinto abalone (*Haliotis kamtschatkana*) abundance declined drastically in Southeast Alaska, largely as a result of overharvest during commercial fisheries in the 1980s and 1990s. These declines reduced abalone abundance so much that abalone are no longer found at their traditional harvesting sites. We were interested to explore abalone cryptic behavior, as it may reflect how susceptible they are to predation and may change with variation in resource availability and substrate type. We worked with a local Alaska Native tribe, the Hydaburg Cooperative Association, and local harvesters, who identified 18 traditional harvest sites with historically high abalone abundances in their region. At each site we surveyed one 20 x 2 m transect within the depth where traditional harvest occurs (1 m) and one below the reach of most traditional harvesters (3 m), but within the optimal abalone depth range. We quantified abalone density and scored each abalone’s cryptic behavior on a scale from very hidden to completely exposed. We categorized primary and secondary substrate types and calculated an overall complexity score for each transect. Because large abalone are harder to remove from the rocks making them less susceptible to predation, we hypothesize that larger abalone would be more exposed than smaller abalone. If abalone prefer to seek out resources rather than hide from predators, then abalone should be found to be exposed no matter the substrate complexity. We plan to share our results with local harvesters to provide information on the status of this valuable resource.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Waldschmidt, A.J.",University of Alaska Southeast,University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Bolwerk, A.T.",University of Alaska Fairbanks,"Eckert, G.L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,3,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Community/Ecosystem Ecology,,,,
"Weinstock, Jane",,jweinstock@whoi.edu,,,,,LUNAR AND TIDAL CYCLES IN BARNACLE (*CHTHAMALUS* SPP.) TIMING OF REPRODUCTION AND SETTLEMENT,"Barnacles are important competitors for space in intertidal habitats, and the timing of their reproduction and settlement plays a major role in determining their potential dispersal and ultimate recruitment. Our goal was to monitor *Chthamalus* spp. in coastal Southern California over multiple years to test whether lunar and tidal cycles play a role in local timing of reproduction and settlement. We collected 100 adult barnacles daily from June to November 2016 and May to August 2017 at Bird Rock, San Diego. We inspected individuals under a stereomicroscope and categorized them by reproductive stage, ultimately calculating the proportion of each stage per sampling date. Settlement plates were also collected and replaced daily from April to July 2014, October 2014 to January 2015, April to August 2015, September to December 2015, and April to July 2016. The number of settlers were counted and normalized by suitable settlement area. Sea level data were obtained from a NOAA tide station at La Jolla, CA, and temperature data were collected near the settlement plates. For all biological, sea level, and temperature data, we calculated and assigned each sampling date to a lunar day. We then used a randomization test to evaluate the periodicity of reproduction and settlement. Our results revealed significant periodicity corresponding to lunar and tidal cycles in *Chthamalus* spp. reproduction, but not in settlement, indicating that these patterns exist in reproduction but potentially break down during dispersal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Weinstock, J.B.",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,University of San Diego,"Reyns, N.B.",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,"Pineda, J.",University of San Diego,"Swiderski, M.",University of San Diego,"Flerchinger, D.",,,,,,,,,5,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Woods, Mackenzie",,mbwoods@uvic.ca,,,,,SHIPS AND MIDSHIPMAN FISH: HOW BOAT NOISE AFFECTS AGGRESSION AND PARENTAL CARE OF THE PLAINFIN MIDSHIPMAN FISH,"Many fishes are largely reliant on sound for communication, prey and predator detection, and navigation. Over the last century, rising levels of anthropogenic noise have been introduced into the ocean, greatly altering the underwater soundscape. The highly vocal plainfin midshipman fish, *Porichthys notatus*, has a long and energetically-costly parental care period, during which a male guards a nest and cares for his eggs. *P. notatus* relies on sound production and reception for mate attraction and agonistic encounters, including nest defence; therefore, alteration of the environmental soundscape has the potential to affect reproductive behaviour, including nest-guarding and parental care. We are conducting a two-part study to investigate the effect of boat noise on the behaviour of *P. notatus* guarder males during nest defence. Using a within-subjects design, we exposed guarder males to a nest-invading crab threat stimulus in the presence and absence of boat noise. We first conducted these experiments using fish housed in individual tanks; the captive fish exhibited more aggressive behaviours in trials during boat noise playback compared to trials with only ambient conditions. We then repeated the experiments *in situ* at an intertidal breeding site. Our results will help explain how boat noise affects fish behaviour and mediates parental care. As anthropogenic noise continues to increase, understanding how it affects aquatic organisms is crucial in order to appropriately mitigate such effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Woods, M.B.",University of Victoria,"McMaster University, University of Victoria","Brown, N.A.W.",McMaster University,"Balshine, S.",University of Victoria,"Juanes, F.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Organismal/Population Biology,,,,
"Wu, Marissa",,m.velarde@csu.fullerton.edu,,,,,"EFFECT OF SHELL AND MUSCLE CONTRACTION BEHAVIOR ON GAMETE PLUMES AND EGG VELOCITIES OF THE RED ABALONE, *HALIOTIS RUFESCENS*","Abalones and other free-spawning marine invertebrates require dense aggregated populations for successful fertilization. Due to a long history of anthropogenic impacts, most Southern California abalone populations exist in low density aggregations. Reduced adult aggregations that are few and far apart may impact fertilization success. Abalones have evolved specific reproductive strategies to assist with fertilization success such as synchronized spawning and conspecific sperm chemotaxis. Abalones have also been observed to contract their muscular bodies while spawning, which may be a mechanism as yet unquantified that could assist with successful fertilization. We are examining the effects of bodily muscular contractions on gamete plume heights and gamete velocities in the red abalone, *Haliotis rufescens*. We hypothesize that the heights of ejected gamete plumes will increase with increasing contractile force, but that the gamete velocities are more density dependent. We measured the force of spawning red abalone contractions with a force transducer, while simultaneously recording the heights of the resultant gamete plumes with a GoPro, and capturing the egg particles as they exit the respiratory pores in high-speed frames of an Edgertronic camera. We measured the parameters of the plumes and gametes on Kinovea and compared them to the force data. Our novel research will enhance our knowledge of evolved abalone behaviors that assist in fertilization success and help guide out-planting strategies for on-going and future abalone reintroductions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wu, M.L.V.",California State University Fullerton,California State University Fullerton,"Paig-Tran, E.W.M.",California State University Fullerton,"Forsgren, K.L.",California State University Fullerton,"Zacherl, D.C.",,,,,,,,,,,4,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),,,,
"Wuest, Anna",,anna.wuest0@gmail.com,,,,,Insights into black-footed albatross bycatch in US west coast fisheries using Bayesian models,"Globally, seabird populations are declining due to factors such as pollution, climate change, introduction of predators, and interactions with fisheries. Incidental bycatch in U.S. West coast longline fisheries significantly contributes to the mortality of the black-footed albatross (BFAL). BFAL populations are stable but predicted to decline over the next half century. My project focuses on testing multiple Bayesian time series models to understand the factors that contribute to BFAL bycatch in a U.S. West Coast longline fishery. We tested model performance assuming two different distributions of the bycatch (negative binomial, Poisson), and examined constant versus non-constant bycatch rates. We also incorporated combinations of seven unique covariates to determine if a relationship exists between these covariates and the bycatch rate. We used leave-one-out cross validation to quantitatively evaluate the models. Results indicated that the best model of seabird bycatch used a negative binomial distribution with a constant bycatch rate. These results suggest that the distribution of bycatch is dispersed and that the underlying bycatch rate from year to year remains relatively constant. Of the covariates used, streamer lines, season, and floated longlines had the most predictive results this indicates that these covariates all have the capacity to affect the bycatch rate. The results of our work demonstrate clear improvements over previous methods of bycatch modeling and suggest factors that managers might use to reduce seabird bycatch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jannot, J.E.",NOAA,NOAA,"Good, T.P.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,"Yes, I would like to present a poster",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applied Ecology/Conservation Biology (Mia Tegner Award),,,,
